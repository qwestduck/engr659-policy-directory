No-show/Late Cancellation Fees 
 
 
Summary/Purpose: To define the University Counseling Center no-show and late cancellation 

fee policy. 

 

 
 Due to the heavy demand for services, a no-show fee/late cancellation fee of $20 for 

individual student appointments will be charged to the client’s Bursar account, if they fail 

to notify the Counseling Center that they will not be attending. The client must notify the 

Counseling Center at least 2 hours prior to their scheduled appointment. 

 Effective July 1, 2017, any client not present within 15 minutes of the session start time 

may be counted as a no-show.  These amounts will be charged to the client’s Bursar 

account. 

 A client can notify the Counseling Center through email (counslg@olemiss.edu); by 

telephone (662) 915-3784; or in person at the Counseling Center.
