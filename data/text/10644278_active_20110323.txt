Documenting Financial/Accounting Transactions 
 
 

Summary/Purpose:  All university faculty and staff initiating, preparing, completing or 
approving any financial transactions that are submitted to the Accounting Office for 
processing must ensure the document includes complete information about the transaction.  
For departments completing general ledger entries that are not sent to the Accounting Office, 
the documentation should be maintained within the department.
