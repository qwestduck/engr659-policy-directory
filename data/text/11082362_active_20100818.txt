Summary/Purpose: Defining the role of students as principal investigators on research projects 
involving human subjects. 
 
UM undergraduate and graduate students may serve as principal investigators (PIs) on research 
projects with human subjects, but they must have a UM faculty member as a research advisor on 
the project.
