the disclosure of an individual’s protected health information (PHI). 

 
2.0 SCOPE 

 
The UM Disclosures of Protected Health Information (PHI) for Administrative and 
Judicial Purposes Policy applies to any UM employee responsible for disclosing 
patient’s PHI to administrative or judicial personnel. 

 
3.1 STANDARDS 

 
UM is permitted by law to disclose an individual’s PHI in response to the following: 
 

• A court order; or 
• An administrative tribunal order. 

 
UM should disclose only PHI that is specifically indicated in the order. 

 
UM may also disclose PHI in response to the following so long as a court order or 
administrative tribunal order accompanies it: 
 

• Subpoena; 
• Discovery request; or 
• Other lawful process. 

 
In cases where a subpoena, discovery or other lawful process is not accompanied by a 
court order or administrative tribunal order, UM can disclose the PHI so long as UM 
receives from the party making the request, a written statement and accompanying 
documentation demonstrating that:

• The party has made a good faith attempt to provide written notice to the 
individual whose PHI is being requested (or, if the individual’s location is 
unknown to mail a notice to the individual’s last known address); 
• The notice must have included sufficient information about the litigation or 
proceeding in which the PHI is requested to permit the individual to raise an 
objection to the court or administrative tribunal; 
• UM may disclose the PHI if the time for the individual to raise objections to the 
court or administrative tribunal has elapsed, and (1) no objections were filed; or 
(2) if objections were filed, the court or administrative tribunal has resolved all 
objections filed by the individual and the disclosures being sought are consistent 
with such resolution; 
• The parties to the dispute have agreed to a qualified protective order and have 
presented it to the court or administrative tribunal with jurisdiction over the 
dispute; or 
• The party seeking the PHI has requested a qualified protective order from such 
court or administrative tribunal. 

 
For guidance on responding to court orders, subpoenas or any other such concerns, 
employees should contact the UM Office of General Counsel.
