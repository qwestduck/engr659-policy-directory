Summary:  How to de-identify PHI so that it may be disclosed without authorization 
 
Affected Individuals:  Staff at HIPAA covered entities 

 

1.0 PURPOSE 
 

To ensure that when The University of Mississippi (UM) releases protected health 
information (PHI) without an authorization, in situations where an authorization would 
normally be required, it is de-identified using the safe  harbor method as it is defined by 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Regulations, 45 
CFR Part 164.514. 

 
2.0 SCOPE 

 
The UM Disclosures of De-identified Protected Health Information (PHI) Policy applies 
to any UM employee who releases PHI without an authorization. 

 
3.1 STANDARDS 

 
Deidentifying PHI requires removing any information that would allow an individual to 
indentify the individual(s) who are the subject of the information.  This rule applies even if 
the person receiving the information would need additional information to identify the 
subject of the PHI.  The following information must usually be removed from the PHI before 
disclosure. Under some circumstances additional identifiers would need to be removed: 

 Names; 

 Relatives, household members, or the employer of the subject of the PHI; 

 All geographic subdivisions smaller than a state, including street, address, 
city, county, precinct, zip code, and their equivalent geocodes, except for 
the initial three digits of a zip code if, according to the current publicly 
available data from the Bureau of the Census: 

o The geographic unit formed by combining all zip codes with the 
same three initial digits contains more than 20,000 people; and 

o The initial three digits of a zip code for all such geographic units 
containing 20,000 or fewer people is changed to 000;
