Nonresident Fee Waiver for Employees and Spouses of Employees 
 

Summary/Purpose:   An explanation is given of the qualifications needed to receive a waiver of 
the nonresident fee for employees and their spouses. 

Full-time employees and their spouses are eligible for a waiver of the nonresident fee.  Part-time 
employees, employed one-half time or more, and their spouses, qualify for this waiver only on 
the course work allowed under the Further Education policy for part-time employees (one course 
not to exceed four semester hours during each regular semester and each summer term). Spouses 
must obtain a fee waiver from the Department of Human Resources. The employee must be 
employed as of the first date of the term for which the benefit is provided.
