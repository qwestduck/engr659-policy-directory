Use of Non-Pharmaceutical Grade Drugs 
 
Summary/Purpose: To provide guidance in regard to the use of non-pharmaceutical grade drugs 
in the care and use of Laboratory Animals at the University of Mississippi. 
 
Description:  
The following addresses the guidance provided in the APHIS Animal Care Resource Guide, 
Issue Date March 25, 2011 – Policy # 3 regarding non-pharmaceutical grade compounds in 
research (http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_welfare/policy.php?policy=3). 
 
The Animal Welfare Act (AWA), Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of 
laboratory Animals and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, require that all 
animals used in research be provided adequate Veterinary Care. The United States Department of 
Agriculture in their Animal Care policies published in March of 2011 states:  “Investigators are 
expected to use pharmaceutical-grade medications whenever they are available, even in acute 
procedures.” To assure that animals used in research and teaching at the University of 
Mississippi (Oxford Campus) receive adequate Veterinary Care, the Institutional Animal Care 
and Use Committee has developed the following Policy.  
 
Definition:   
Pharmaceutical Grade – meets pharmaceutical standards. There are several criteria by which 
pharmaceutical grade drugs are judged. Lists of chemical compounds available in pharmaceutical 
grade can be found in either the human or veterinary PDR. 
 
Non-pharmaceutical-grade compounds can be used only in research/testing activities utilizing 
animals if reviewed and approved by the IACUC.  
 
 The following circumstances must be met for consideration by the IACUC: 
 

1. The research activity requires the use of non-pharmaceutical-grade compounds for 
reason of scientific necessity. 

 
2. Acceptable veterinary or human pharmaceutical-grade products are not available or 

are not available in appropriate concentrations. (Most novel compounds are in this 
category.) 

 
3. Cost savings alone are not an adequate justification for using non-pharmaceutical-

grade compounds in animals. 
 
4. For all species, any non-pharmaceutical chemical agents administered parenterally 

(by injection) in survival studies should be sterile, maintained in a sterile container, 
and labeled to provide the mixing date, name and concentration of the compound as 
well as its expiration date. Heat-stable compounds may be sterilized by autoclaving, 
and those that are not heat stable can be sterilized by microfiltration.  The Investigator 
is responsible for determining the “shelf” life for the compound after being dissolved

in solvent. If the “shelf life” is not obtainable, it is recommended that the solution be 
prepared each day it is used.
