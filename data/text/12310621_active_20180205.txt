Summary:  Ensuring PHI is protected in HIPAA covered entities by protecting 

networks and supporting infrastructure 
 

Affected Individuals:  Employees in HIPAA covered entities; IT staff 

 

Purpose of Policy 

The purpose of this policy is to ensure the protection of University of Mississippi (UM) data, especially 
confidential data in UM’s networks, and protection of the supporting network infrastructure. 

 
The secure management of UM’s network requires careful consideration of the flow of information and 
the regulatory requirements regarding monitoring and protection of its networks. 

 
Definitions 

For a complete list of definitions, refer to the Glossary. 

 
Scope 

This policy applies only to covered entities as defined in the University of Mississippi (UM) HIPAA 
hybrid policy. This policy applies to all users and computing devices connecting to any UM 
information systems network. 

 
Policy 

A. Network Controls 

1. UM manages and controls its networks in order to protect UM data and other 
information assets that access, traverse, or reside within UM’s network. 

2. UM specifies the networks and network services to which users are authorized access. 

3. A current network diagram exists of the covered entity areas and is updated whenever 
there are network changes and no less than every 6 months. 

4. The network diagram is made immediately and continuously available for official 
operational, planning, and coordination purposes. The network diagram is classified as

internal-use-only and is handled in accordance with the Data Classification and Handling 
Policy. 

5. All databases, servers and other system components storing or processing confidential data 
are placed behind a firewall to limit external network traffic to the internal network. 

6. Routing controls are implemented through security gateways (e.g., firewalls) used between 
internal and external networks (e.g., the Internet and 3rd party networks). 

7. Changes to the DMZ which affect the security posture are approved by the Chief 
Information Security Officer (CISO) and documented in the network diagram. 

8. UM’s confidential data is logically and/or physically partitioned by means of network 
architecture design and connectivity except where the risk of not doing so is accepted by 
the CISO. 

9. Where feasible, network devices are identified and authenticated prior to establishing a 
connection. 

10. Firewalls are configured to deny inbound traffic by default (deny all, permit by exception). 

11. Servers hosting UM confidential data are not visible to the internet, nor to unprotected 
internal subnets. 

12. The firewall rule set is reviewed periodically. 

13. Firewalls restrict inbound traffic to the minimum necessary. 

14. UM utilizes firewalls that employ stateful packet inspection. 

15. Firewall and router baseline configuration standards are defined and implemented and 
reviewed annually. 

16. Firewall, router, and network connection changes are approved and tested prior to 
implementing the changes. Changes are documented in accordance with the Configuration 
Management Policy. If testing cannot be accomplished prior to implementation, the

proposed changes and a rollback plan must be approved by the CISO prior to 
implementation. 

17. Where feasible, UM uses at least two different DNS servers for internal name resolution. 

18. Semi-annual network scans are performed to identify unauthorized components and devices. 

B. Security of Outsourced Network Services 

1. Security features, service levels, and management requirements for all network services are 
identified and included in any network services agreement. 

 

2. Formal agreements with third party network service providers includes specific obligations 
for security and privacy. 

3. Services provided by a third party network service provider are formally managed and 
regularly monitored to ensure they are in accordance with the terms of the formal 
agreements. 

Policy Compliance 

Enforcement 

The CISO, or designee, has general responsibility for the implementation and enforcement of this policy. 

 

Future Revisions

committee), or any other Information Security Policy without prior notice to users.

appropriate, up to and including termination and criminal and/or civil prosecution in accordance with 
policy. 

 

Exceptions 

Exceptions to this policy must follow the approved exception process as outlined in the Information 
Security Waiver Policy. All approved policy exceptions shall be reviewed periodically for appropriateness
