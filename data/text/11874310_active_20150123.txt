Suspension or Debarment from Federal Programs 

Summary/Purpose:  Individuals who have been suspended or debarred by federal agencies may 

not work in positions where they would have a substantive influence over “covered transactions” 

related to federal student aid 

 

Affected Individuals:  University employees with influence over covered transactions under 

Title IV 

 

Federal law prohibits individuals who have been debarred or suspended by a federal agency from 

being employed in a position where the employee may have the ability to handle, control, or 

influence the distribution of Title IV federal student aid funds.  Examples of such positions 

include, but are not limited to, upper administrative positions, and positions in the Office of 

Financial Aid, the Office of the Bursar, Accounting and Career Services.   

 

An individual who has been debarred or suspended must notify his or her supervisor 

immediately.  Suspension or debarment by a federal agency may result in immediate termination 

of the individual’s employment with the University if the employee works in a position where he 

or she has substantive influence over covered transactions. 

 

Any exception to this policy must be approved by the Vice Chancellor of the relevant Division 

and the Office of General Counsel.  An exception will not be approved if it may possibly 

jeopardize the University’s participation in Title IV programs.
