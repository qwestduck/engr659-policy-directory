ELEVATORS 

 

Purpose/Summary: This policy defines the expectations for appropriate use of residence 

hall elevators.  

 

Each resident is responsible for the proper use and care of residence hall elevators. Residents are 

not to overload or force the doors of elevators. Unauthorized personnel are prohibited from 

entering the elevator shaft. Emergency call buttons are to be used only in case of an emergency. 

Elevator surfing is considered extremely dangerous. Students found tampering with, vandalizing, 

surfing, or misusing the elevators are subject to judicial action with possible eviction from 

Residence Halls. Repairs to elevators can be extremely expensive and vandalism charges are 

routinely billed back to individuals, floors, or hall communities if violators cannot be found.
