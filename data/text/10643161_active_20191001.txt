The University of Mississippi 
 
 

Against Medical Advice (AMA) 
 
Summary/Purpose: To legally protect the health care provider and the University of 
Mississippi, and to provide legal documentation to the patient. 

 
 
It is the prerogative of any legally responsible and mentally competent patient to refuse medical 
intervention at the Student Health Service. 

 
Procedure: 

 
1. When medical intervention is refused by the patient, the health care provider is to 

document the incident in the patient’s medical record, along with recommended 
treatments and therapies, alternatives available, and consequences that may occur with 
refusal of treatment. 

 
2. The health care provider is under no obligation to comply with patient demands for 

treatment/therapy which are against the best medical judgement of the provider. 
 
3. The AMA form should be dated, signed and witnessed, and becomes a part of the 

patient’s permanent medical record.
