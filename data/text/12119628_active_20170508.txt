Income from Textbooks and Materials Authored by Faculty 
 

 

Summary / Purpose:  To provide a structure for ethically dealing with the assignment of 

textbooks or other class materials by a faculty member where that faculty member may benefit 

financially from that assignment, either directly or because the assignment will benefit a relative 

or a business with which the faculty member is associated.  

 

The University of Mississippi encourages its faculty members to publish in their fields of 

expertise, including textbooks and other classroom materials.  The university further recognizes 

that it is often beneficial to students for faculty members to teach from textbooks or other 

materials that they have authored, co-authored or edited.   

 

Under Mississippi ethics laws, however, a faculty member may not use his or her position to 

obtain a pecuniary benefit for himself or herself, for a relative, or for an associated business. This 

policy ensures that a faculty member will not obtain any pecuniary benefit from a decision to 

assign a textbook or other classroom materials authored, edited, or compiled by the faculty 

member by removing the possibility that pecuniary benefit would result from the assignment. 

Where that possibility cannot be effectively eliminated by this policy, then the policy provides 

that others will make the final decision about assigned materials.  

 

Definitions: 

 

Business Association – A faculty member or relative has a Business Association with any 

business entity if the faculty member or Relative has received more than $2,500.00 in income 

from that business entity during any of the previous three years or if the faculty member or 

Relative owns at least 10% of the fair market value of the business entity. 

 

Relative – the spouse, child, parent or sibling of a faculty member, or the spouse of any of these 

individuals. 

 

Publishing Company – A business entity that publishes textbooks. 

 

Textbook – In this policy, “Textbook” (with a capital “T”) refers to a book or other class 

materials assigned by a faculty member that either was authored, co-authored, or edited by a 

faculty member or a Relative of the assigning faculty member. 

 

Policy: 

 

This policy is not intended to prevent faculty members from assigning materials that are best 

suited to support the course, even if this includes a Textbook as defined in this policy.  Instead, 

this policy manages the potential conflicts and removes any appearance of impropriety. 

 

Textbooks for multiple classes:  If a textbook or other class materials are being selected for use 

in multiple classes, either within a department or across departments, and a faculty-authored 

Textbook is among the course materials being considered, then any faculty member who may

benefit from the assignment or who has a Relative or Business Association that may benefit from 

the assignment may not participate in the selection process. 

 

Textbooks for a class taught by the faculty member:  When a faculty member is selecting a 

textbook or other class materials for his or her own class and the faculty member wishes to select 

a Textbook as defined by this policy, then the faculty member must submit a written request to 

his or her department chair.  The application must state: 

 

a. The name of the Textbook being considered;  
b. Alternate textbooks or materials considered; 
c. Why use of the Textbook would be more beneficial for students than other texts 

or materials that could have been selected.  

d. The identity of the Publishing Company; 
e. Information necessary to determine whether the faculty member has a Business 

Association with the Publishing Company, including: 

i. The percentage of the fair market value of the Publishing Company owned 
by the faculty member or relative; or 

ii. The amount of income that the faculty member or relative has received 
from the Publishing Company in each of the past three years; 

f. The maximum number of students who may enroll in the class that would be 
using the Textbook if selected during the term at issue;  

g. The expected income to be received by the faculty member or his or her Relative 
for each Textbook sold; 

h. A statement that, upon written approval to use the Textbook, the faculty member 
will make a contribution to The University of Mississippi Foundation for the 

expected income per Textbook multiplied by the number of students who will be 

using the text.  

 

If the faculty member does not have a Business Association with the Publishing Company for the 

Textbook and the assignment of the Textbook would not benefit a Relative, then the chair of the 

faculty member’s department will review the application and make a final decision in writing 

concerning its assignment by the faculty member.  This information will be forwarded to the 

Office of the Provost to be kept as a record of the decision.   

 

If the faculty member has a Business Association with the Publishing Company for the Textbook 

or if the assignment of the Textbook would benefit a Relative, the application should be sent to 

the Office of the Provost where it will be reviewed and a final decision will be made.   

 

Textbooks should not be approved for classroom use if a reasonable faculty member in the field 

of study would not believe that the use of the Textbook is in the best interest of the students. 

 

Faculty members who have not followed this procedure may be required to refrain from using 

their own Textbooks in future classes and may face other repercussions under Mississippi ethics 

laws.
