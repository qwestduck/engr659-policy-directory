Full‐Time Status for Internship and Cooperative Education 
Programs 

 
 

The purpose of this policy is to provide full‐time status to students participating in certain 

Internships and Cooperative Education programs who are not registered for a full‐time course 

load. In order for a student to be eligible for this full‐time status, the program must be rigorous 

and the time commitments must be approved through various university channels, including the 

Academic Department and the Office of the Registrar. This designation will allow these students 

the benefits and privileges provided to full‐time students, allowing them full participation in and 

access to the services, programs, facilities, and activities of The University of Mississippi.
