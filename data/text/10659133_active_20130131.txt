Further Education 
 

Summary/Purpose:  With approval of the department head, qualifying employees may enroll 
for course work to further their education.  The regulations are given as to the number of courses 
allowed for full-time, part-time and temporary employees for the regular semesters, summer 
school and intersession.  Requirements are also given for registration, how retirees are eligible 
for course work and what is necessary if a course is not successfully completed. 

 
With the approval of the department head, qualifying employees may enroll for course work on a 
space available basis. The employee must have been employed prior to the end of the late 
registration process. Tuition waivers will not be granted for intersession courses. Courses taken 
for audit credit will be allowed if they are work related; any course may be taken for credit. The 
employee must be eligible for college entrance to qualify for credit in the course(s). Continuing 
Education and Independent Study credit courses are included under this policy. 

 
Full-time employees may enroll in any semester for one course that meets during the standard 
workday; total time away from work may not exceed four clock hours per week. Four hours is 
defined as one 3-hour course and the requisite 1-hour lab or practical review class for 100 
level Modern Language courses and 100 & 200 level science courses. (Employees are not 
allowed any free clock hours away from work during intersession periods.) Tuition will be 
waived for two courses not to exceed 8 semester hours for employees who qualify to take 
courses for credit.  Full-time employees may be permitted to take one course during each 
summer term (Note:  an employee may only take a maximum of two (2) classes for all summer 
terms combined) provided their work schedule can be arranged to make up all hours in excess of 
four clock hours per week missed during the regular workday. Additional courses may be taken 
outside the standard workday at the employee's expense if they do not adversely affect the 
employee's work performance. 
 
Employees will continue to be ineligible for those benefits previously associated with student 
activity fees. 

 
Part-time employees, employed one-half time or more, may receive a waiver of tuition for one 
course not to exceed 4 semester hours during each regular semester and each summer term; 
however, part-time employees may not enroll for courses that meet during their scheduled work 
time. 

 
Temporary employees qualify for this benefit under the conditions noted above if they are to be 
employed for the duration of the enrollment period. Temporary staff employees not employed 
under contract will be required to present verification from their department head that they will 
be employed for the duration of the enrollment period. 

 
Employees who do not successfully complete a course (dropping a course after the refund date 
has passed or failing a course are both considered not successfully completing a course) for 
which a waiver has been issued will not be allowed to take additional courses until they 
successfully complete a course at their own expense and justify further course work to their 
supervisor. Eligibility will then be reestablished for waiver of tuition.
