Annual Reports

Summary/Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to inform all regarding Annual Reports
submitted to the Office of the Chancellor.

For the historic record of the University, customarily all units are requested to complete an
annual report in narrative form.  These reports serve as the official record of yearly departmental
and program accomplishments and should be prepared with a great deal of thought and care. 
Report requirements are mailed to Vice Chancellors, Deans, Department Chairs, Directors, and
non-academic Department Heads yearly. 

These reports are kept in the Office of the Chancellor for 10 years then transferred to the
Archives at the J. D. Williams Library for safekeeping.
