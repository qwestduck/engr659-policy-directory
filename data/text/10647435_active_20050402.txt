Classification

A student’s class standing is determined by the number of semester hours of course work
completed, as follows:

Semester Hours
FRESHMAN  0-29
SOPHOMORE 30-59
JUNIOR 60-89
SENIOR 90 or more

The student’s academic dean determines which of the hours of completed course work may be
applied towards a degree. To be classified as full-time, a student must be taking at least 12
semester hours. Students enrolled for fewer than 12 hours are classified as part-time.
