Expectations of Campus Visitors 

Summary/Purpose:  To define and clarify the University’s expectations and standards 
concerning the behavior, conduct, and actions of campus visitors and guests.

PEOPLE AFFECTED:  Visitors 

The University expects campus visitors to follow University standards for behavior while 
attending campus events or visiting the University. Thus, campus visitors must comply with all 
applicable laws, regulations, and policies, including policies that prohibit student misconduct 
(see Student Conduct policies in the University’s Policy Directory). If a visitor to campus 
violates any applicable laws, regulations, or policies or refuses to comply with the same, the 
University may require the campus visitor to leave campus or any campus facility or event, and 
the University may deny future entrance to campus or to any University facility or event.
