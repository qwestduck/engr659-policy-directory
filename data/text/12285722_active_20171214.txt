The University of Mississippi 

Access to Public Records 

 

Summary/Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to establish the procedures for seeking access 

to public records, to protect the privacy of certain records, to ensure compliance with the 

Mississippi Public Records Act, and to ensure compliance with applicable privacy and other 

laws.  This policy applies to all University of Mississippi employees and departments receiving a 

request for public records.  This policy also applies to any individual requesting to inspect, copy 

or review public records possessed by the University of Mississippi. 

I. University Departments and Employees 

Any University of Mississippi employee or department receiving a public records request 

(sometimes described as a “freedom of information” or “FOIA” request) shall immediately 

(within one (1) business day) forward a copy of the request to the Office of General Counsel 

along with all contacts and communications from the requester.  Any University of Mississippi 

employee or department receiving a public records request or possessing requested records or 

information shall cooperate with and assist the Office of General Counsel in responding to a 

request.  Questions regarding this policy or its implementation should be directed to the Office of 

General Counsel. 

II. Submitting a Request for Public Records 

The Mississippi Ethics Commission has developed model rules to provide best practices for 

complying with the Mississippi Public Records Act and to promote a spirit of cooperation 

between public bodies and requestors by standardizing best practices throughout the state.  This 

policy is based on the model rules.  When submitting a request for public records, all individuals 

are required to comply with this policy.  Any questions regarding this policy should be directed 

to the Office of General Counsel. 

III. Process for Responding to a Request for Public Records 

A. Authority and Purpose 

“It is the policy of the Legislature that public records must be available for inspection by any 

person unless otherwise provided by this act. Furthermore, providing access to public records is a 

duty of each public body and automation of public records must not erode the right of access to 

those records.” Miss. Code Ann. § 25-61-1. 

B. Public Records Officer

 (1) Any person wishing to request access to public records of the University of 

Mississippi, or seeking assistance in making such a request should contact the public records 

officer: 

Charlotte Fant Pegues     

Assistant Provost and Registrar 

The University of Mississippi 

Office of the Registrar 

104 Martindale 

University, MS 38677 

 

Email:   publicrecords@olemiss.edu 

Phone:  (662) 915-7014 

Fax:      (662) 915-5640 

 

 (2) The public records officer will oversee compliance with this policy but may designate 

another University of Mississippi staff member to process a request. Therefore, these rules will 

refer to the public records officer "or designee." The public records officer or designee will 

provide assistance to requestors; ensure that public records are protected from damage or 

disorganization; and prevent fulfilling public records requests from causing excessive 

interference with essential functions of the University of Mississippi. 

C. Availability of Public Records 

(1) Hours for inspection of records. Public records are available for inspection and 

copying during normal business hours of the University of Mississippi, Monday through Friday, 

8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., excluding holidays.  The public records officer or designee may work 

with the requester to determine the time, place and manner of inspection and copying of records 

so as not to interfere with other essential duties and functions of the University of Mississippi.  

(2) Organization of records. The University of Mississippi will maintain its records in a 

reasonably organized manner and will take reasonable actions to protect records from damage 

and disorganization. A requestor shall not physically remove or take with them any records 

possessed or maintained by the University of Mississippi.  Numerous records are available on the 

University of Mississippi’s web site at www.olemiss.edu.  Requestors are encouraged to view the 

documents available on the web site prior to submitting a records request.  

(3) Making a request for public records.  

(a) Any person wishing to inspect or copy public records should make the request 

in writing by completing the University of Mississippi’s request form.  The form 

can be found at the end of this policy or can be accessed via the following link: 

https://legal.olemiss.edu/index/public-records-request-form/.  Any person may 

also submit a written request by letter, fax, or e-mail addressed to the public 

mailto:publicrecords@olemiss.edu
http://www.olemiss.edu/
https://legal.olemiss.edu/index/public-records-request-form/

records officer identified in Section III(B)(1) of this policy.  Requests must 

include the following information: 

 Name of requestor;  

 Address of requestor;  

 Other contact information, including telephone number and any e-mail 

address;  

 Identification of the public records adequate for the public records 

officer or designee to locate the records; and  

 The date and time of the request.  

(b) If the requestor wishes to receive copies of the records instead of simply 

inspecting them, he or she should so indicate and make arrangements to pay for 

copies of the records or a deposit.  Pursuant to Section III(H) of this policy, 

standard photocopies will be provided at 15 cents per page.  

(c) The public records officer or designee may accept requests for public records 

that contain the above information by telephone or in person.  If the public 

records officer or designee accepts such a request, he or she will confirm receipt 

of the information and the substance of the request in writing. 

D. Processing of Public Records Requests – General 

 

(1) Providing access. The University of Mississippi acknowledges that providing access 

to public records is a duty and that any person shall have the right to inspect, copy or 

mechanically reproduce or obtain a reproduction of any public record in accordance with these 

rules.  The public records officer or designee will process requests in the order allowing the most 

requests to be processed in the most efficient manner.  

(2) Acknowledging receipt of request. Within five (5) business days of receipt of the 

request, the public records officer will do one or more of the following:  

(a) Make the records available for inspection or copying;  

(b) If copies are requested and payment of a deposit for the copies, if any, is made 

or terms of payment are agreed upon, send the copies to the requestor;  

(c) Provide a reasonable estimate of when records will be available; 



The University of Mississippi 
 

4 
 

(d) Provide a reasonable estimate of the costs associated with responding to the 

 request (this includes the costs associated with compiling, analyzing and 

 potentially redacting responsive records); 

(e) If the request is unclear or does not sufficiently identify the requested records, 

request clarification from the requestor (i.e. clarification may be requested and 

provided by telephone and the public records officer or designee may revise the 

estimate of when records will be available); or  

(f) Deny the request.  

(3) Consequences of failure to respond.  If the University of Mississippi does not 

respond in writing within five (5) business days of receipt of the request, the requestor should 

contact the public records officer to determine the reason for the failure to respond.  

(4) Protecting rights of others.  In the event the requested records contain information 

that may affect rights of others and may be exempt from disclosure, the public records officer or 

designee may, prior to providing the records, give notice to such others whose rights may be 

affected by the disclosure.  Such notice should be given so as to make it possible for those other 

persons to contact the requestor and ask him or her to revise the request, or, if necessary, seek an 

order from a court to prevent or limit the disclosure. The notice to the affected persons will 

include a copy of the request.  

(5) Records exempt from disclosure.  Some records are exempt from or protected from 

disclosure, in whole or in part.  If the University of Mississippi determines that a record is 

exempt from disclosure and should be withheld, the public records officer or designee will state 

the specific exemption and provide a brief explanation of why the record or a portion of the 

record is being withheld.  The University of Mississippi may determine that it can redact 

protected or exempt information and provide the portion of a record that is not protected or 

exempt from disclosure.  In such a case, the public records officer or designee will redact the 

exempt portions, provide the nonexempt portions, and indicate to the requestor why portions of 

the record is redacted.  

(6) Inspection of records.  

(a) Consistent with other demands, the University of Mississippi shall promptly 

provide space to inspect public records. No member of the public may remove a 

document from the viewing area or disassemble or alter any document. The 

requestor shall indicate which documents he or she wishes the University of 

Mississippi to copy.  

(b) The requestor must claim or review the assembled records within thirty (30) 

days of the University of Mississippi’s notification to him or her that the records 



The University of Mississippi 
 

5 
 

are available for inspection or copying. The University of Mississippi will notify 

the requestor in writing of this requirement and inform the requestor that he or she 

contact the public records officer or designee to make arrangements to claim or 

review the records. If the requestor or a representative of the requestor fails to 

claim or review the records within the thirty (30) day period or make other 

arrangements, the University of Mississippi may close the request and refile the 

assembled records. Other public records requests can be processed ahead of a 

subsequent request by the same person for the same or almost identical records, 

which can be processed as a new request.  

(7) Providing copies of records.  After inspection is complete, the public records officer 

or designee shall make the requested copies or arrange for copying.  

(8) Providing records in installments. When the request is for a large number of 

records, the public records officer or designee will provide access for inspection and copying in 

installments, if he or she reasonably determines that it would be practical to provide the records 

in that way.  If, within thirty (30) days, the requestor fails to inspect the entire set of records or 

one or more of the installments, the public records officer or designee may stop searching for the 

remaining records and close the request.  

(9) Completion of inspection. When the inspection of the requested records is complete 

and all requested copies are provided, the public records officer or designee will indicate that the 

University of Mississippi has completed a diligent search for the requested records and made any 

nonexempt records available for inspection.  

(10) Closing withdrawn or abandoned request.  When the requestor either withdraws 

the request or fails to fulfill his or her obligations to inspect the records or pay the deposit or 

final payment for the requested copies, the public records officer or designee will close the 

request and indicate to the requestor that the University of Mississippi has closed the request.  

(11) Later discovered documents. If, after the University of Mississippi has informed 

the requestor that it has provided all available records, the University of Mississippi becomes 

aware of additional responsive documents existing at the time of the request, it will promptly 

inform the requestor of the additional documents and provide them on an expedited basis. 

E. Processing of Public Records Requests – Electronic Records 

 

(1) Requesting electronic records. The process for requesting electronic public records 

is the same as for requesting paper public records.  

(2) Providing electronic records. When a requestor requests records in an electronic 

format, the public records officer or designee will provide the nonexempt records or portions of 

such records that are reasonably locatable in an electronic format that is used by the public body 



The University of Mississippi 
 

6 
 

and is generally commercially available, or in a format that is reasonably translatable from the 

format in which the public body keeps the record. Costs for providing electronic records are 

governed by Section III(H) of this policy.  

(3) Customized access to data bases. With the consent of the requestor, the University 

of Mississippi may provide customized access if the record is not reasonably locatable or not 

reasonably translatable into the format requested. The University of Mississippi may charge the 

actual cost for such customized access. 

F. Exemptions 

 

The Mississippi Public Records Act, as well as other statues and court decisions, provide that 

some documents are exempt from public inspection and copying.  In addition, other statutes or 

rules of law, such as various privacy restrictions, may prohibit disclosure.  Furthermore, the 

provisions of the Mississippi Public Records Act shall not be construed to conflict with, amend, 

repeal or supersede any constitutional or statutory law or decision of a court which declares a 

public record to be confidential or privileged.  Requestors should be aware of the below listed 

exemptions that restrict the availability of some documents held by the University of Mississippi.

G. Third Party Information 

 

When any person files or submits documents with the University of Mississippi which the filer 

contends are exempt from disclosure under the Mississippi Public Records Act, the filer shall 

provide a written statement at the time of filing which shall describe the documents filed and 

which shall fully explain why the documents are designated as exempt from disclosure and must 

specifically cite any statute or other legal authority in support of such designation. Such written 

statement shall itself be a public record subject to disclosure. 

Any document filed with the University of Mississippi which contains trade secrets or 

confidential commercial or financial information subject to the protection of any applicable law 

or court decision shall be clearly designated as such by the filer on its face and accompanying 

cover letter at the time of filing.  Each page of each document shall be marked confidential.  

Upon request to inspect or copy any document so designated, the University of Mississippi shall 

notify the person who filed the document. Thirty (30) days after such notice, the document will 

be made available for public inspection or copying unless the filer shall have obtained a court 

order protecting such records as confidential pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. § 25-61-9. 

If a party fails to clearly designate or mark a document as confidential, the University of 

Mississippi may still provide notice to a third party that the records requested may contain trade 

secrets or confidential commercial or financial information.  Thirty (30) days after such notice, 

the document will be made available for public inspection or copying unless the party obtains a 

court order protecting such records as confidential pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. § 25-61-9. 

Any person filing documents with the University of Mississippi shall, prior to filing, redact from 

the documents any social security numbers, account numbers or dates of birth not required to be 

listed. The University of Mississippi shall determine on a case-by-case basis whether similar 

information may be redacted by the filer to prevent identity theft.  In no event will the University 

of Mississippi bear any responsibility for a filer’s failure to redact such information which leads 

to or may lead to identity theft or other crime or loss. 

H. Costs of Providing Public Records 

Miss. Code Ann. § 25-61-7(1) reads as follows: “Except as provided in subsection (2) of this 

section, each public body may establish and collect fees reasonably calculated to reimburse it for, 



The University of Mississippi 
 

9 
 

and in no case to exceed, the actual cost of searching, reviewing and/or duplicating and, if 

applicable, mailing copies of public records.  Any staff time or contractual services included in 

actual cost shall be at the pay scale of the lowest level employee or contractor competent to 

respond to the request.  Such fees shall be collected by the public body in advance of complying 

with the request.”  

(1) Costs for paper copies.  A requestor may obtain standard black and white 

photocopies for 15 cents per page. Copy charges for some specific types of records are set by 

statute and may exceed the amount stated above.  

(2) Costs for electronic records.  The cost of electronic copies of records shall be $5.00 

for information on a CD-ROM.  The cost of scanning existing University of Mississippi paper or 

other non-electronic records is 5 cents per page.  There will be no charge for e-mailing electronic 

records to a requestor, unless another cost applies. 

(3) Costs of mailing. The University of Mississippi may also charge actual costs 

associated with mailing public records, including the cost of the shipping container.  

(4) Payment.  Payment may be made by cash, check, or money order to the University of 

Mississippi.  Payment should be sent to the attention of the public records officer.  Before 

beginning to make the copies, the requestor must pre-pay all reasonably estimated costs of 

copying all the records selected by the requestor.  The public records officer or designee may 

also require the payment of the remainder of the copying costs before providing all the records in 

an installment before providing that installment. The University of Mississippi will not charge 

sales tax when it makes copies of public records.  

(5) Charges for searching, reviewing and redacting.  The actual cost of searching, 

reviewing and, if necessary, redacting exempt information from public records shall be based 

upon the hourly rate of compensation for the lowest paid agency employee qualified to perform 

the task, which shall be multiplied by the actual time to complete the task.  Such fees shall be 

collected by the public body in advance of complying with the request. 

I. Review of Denials of Requests for Public Records 

 

(1) Petition for internal administrative review of denial of access.  Any person who 

objects to the initial denial or partial denial of a records request may petition in writing 

(including e-mail) to the public records officer for a review of that decision. The petition must 

include a copy of or reasonably identify the written statement by the public records officer or 

designee denying the request.  

(2) Consideration of petition for review. The public records officer must promptly 

provide the petition and any other relevant information to the Provost for the University of 

Mississippi.  The Provost for the University of Mississippi will immediately consider the petition 



The University of Mississippi 
 

10 
 

and either affirm or reverse the denial within three (3) business days following the University of 

Mississippi’s receipt of the petition, or within such other time as the University of Mississippi 

and the requestor mutually agree to.  

(3) Review by the Ethics Commission.  If the University of Mississippi denies a 

requestor access to public records, the requestor may ask the Mississippi Ethics Commission to 

review the matter. The Mississippi Ethics Commission has adopted rules on such requests. They 

may be found at www.ethics.state.ms.us.  

(4) Judicial review.  Any person whose request for public records was denied may 

institute a suit in the chancery court of Lafayette County seeking to reverse the denial, as set 

forth in Miss. Code Ann. § 25-61-13.
