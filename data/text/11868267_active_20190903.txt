Voter Registration Information  

DSA.DS.700.001  
 

Summary/Purpose:  This policy is designed to remind students each year about registering 

to vote. 

 

In support of our mission and values, the University of Mississippi encourages all students to 

participate in local, state, and national elections. As part of our responsibility to promote good 

citizenship, as well as good scholarship, the University urges all students to register to vote. The 

following website was coordinated by University student leaders in an effort to support the 

student vote: http://vote.olemiss.edu/.  

 

Students who are not registered to vote are reminded that in order to vote in the State of 

Mississippi, they must register at least 30 days prior to an election. For information on elections 

and voting in Mississippi (including a downloadable application to register to vote), visit:

For information on voting in other states visit: 

http://www.eac.gov/voter_resources/register_to_vote.aspx.  

 

Upon request, the University will provide a paper copy of the voter registration form. Such 

request should be made to the Ole Miss Student Union.
