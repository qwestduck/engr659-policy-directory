Participation in Wellness Program Activities 

Summary/Purpose: Employee participation in wellness program activities, including 

on-site seminars, demonstrations, challenges, and physical fitness activities, is supported 

by our University leaders as well as authorized by Mississippi Senate Bill 2646 of 2010.   

 

This policy is in place to support the University’s objective of enhancing individual 

health, community well-being, and positive work/life balance.  

 

In addition to establishing a comprehensive State Employee Wellness Program of 

Mississippi, Mississippi Senate Bill 2646 authorizes participation and allows for the 

following: 

 

1. A department head may provide flexibility in scheduling to allow for physical activity 
and participation in the University’s wellness program.  Department heads should 

reference the “Flextime” policy, which includes flexible schedule standards. 

 

2. A department may allow its employees to participate in approved wellness-related 
activities for up to three hours each month.  The needs of the department will take 

precedence over individual preferences.   Examples of approved wellness-related 

activities include the University’s program’s hosted walks, cooking demonstrations, 

and physical fitness activities conducted on campus.  

 

3. The department may allow employees to attend on-site wellness seminars when 
offered. 

 

An employee with a pattern of tardiness/absences or poor work performance may not be 

eligible to participate during the regular work schedule.  Consultation with Human 

Resources is suggested when there is a question of whether or not an activity is approved. 

 

The University also recognizes this policy may yield positive business results, such as 

reduced healthcare costs, reduced absenteeism, improved productivity, lower turnover, 

and enhanced University image.
