Temporary Employment 

Summary/Purpose: Temporary employment is defined and the procedure for the employment 
of faculty and staff in this category is explained. This includes information of benefits 
eligibility, time limits, and the procedures to use when listing a temporary job. 

 
There are two basic types of temporary employees: temporary and periodic. However, because 
of state laws regarding membership in the Public Employees' Retirement System (including the 
Optional Retirement Plan) and other employee benefits, temporary employment is further 
subdivided into two categories based upon length of anticipated employment. Therefore, the 
following three categories of University temporary employment are defined: 

 
1. Temporary I:  Temporary employee a s s i g n e d  t o  w o r k  for a department on a regular 

basis for a short period of time not to exceed four and one-half (4½) months. 
 

2. Temporary II:  Temporary employee who works for a department on a regular basis for 
longer  than four and one-half (4½) months, but no longer than 12 months except in the case 
of a  Postdoctoral Research Associate who may be employed on a temporary basis up  to  
5 years. Temporary II employees assigned to at least one-half time (20 hours per week) and 
at least  four  and  one-half  (4½)  consecutive  months,  require  placement  into  the  
Public Employees' Retirement System and are classified as benefit-eligible. 

 
3. Periodic:  Temporary employee who works for a department irregularly and for short periods 

of time on a recurring basis. 
 

Faculty can be employed under Temporary I and II categories, but not periodic. If faculty 
employment is anticipated for at least a semester, Temporary II will apply. 

 
The maximum time limit for Temporary I is 4½ months and for Temporary II is 12 months, with 
the exception of Postdoctoral Research Associates that may be assigned up to three years. 
 
Temporary II employees who have worked 12 months may not be reemployed as a temporary 
employee by the University until there has been a break in service of at least 30 days. 

 
A Periodic employee may be employed on a sporadic basis for up to three years provided the 
employee is not employed one-half time (20 hours per week) or more for four and one-half (4½) 
consecutive months, requiring placement into the Public Employees' Retirement System. 
Periodic employees should be separated when their period of service is complete, unless 
they are to work again after a brief break in service (normally no longer than a month).
