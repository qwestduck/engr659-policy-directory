Terminal Interviews 
 

Summary/Purpose: Examples are given of situations that may deem it necessary for an 
employee to finalize issues with their department or Human Resources along with procedures to 
follow when an employee leaves the University.  

A number of situations may deem it necessary for an employee to finalize issues with their 
department or Human Resources. Examples could include returning university equipment, keys, 
gas cards and/or procurement cards, resolving petty cash custodianships, etc. Therefore, 
individuals are normally expected to be present at their duty station on their last day of 
employment.  

Anytime a petty cash custodian terminates employment with the University, an audit must be 
requested by the custodian's supervisor to either change the custodian or close the account. This 
must be done prior to the employee leaving the University. 

Terminating Employees and their department must complete the Exit Checklist Form prior to 
exiting the University.  This form can be found on the Human Resources website.
