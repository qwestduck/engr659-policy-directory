University Standing Committees

Summary/Purpose:  The purpose of this policy is to define University Standing Committees.

The University Standing Committees are appointed by the Chancellor to bring together faculty,
staff, alumni, students, and administrators for the purpose of collecting, exchanging, and
weighing information and opinions and submitting to the Chancellor and/or Provost
recommendations for changes that the committees deem necessary for the general good of the
University.  Each committee has the responsibility of continually reviewing practices and
policies in its area of concern, as well as performing specifically designated duties.  The
University Standing Committees are advisory to the Chancellor and/or Provost and, as such,
perform a significant role in the governance of the University.
