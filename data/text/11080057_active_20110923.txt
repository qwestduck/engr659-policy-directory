The University of Mississippi 

Drugs and Drug Paraphernalia 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Use and possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia.  
 
 
Drug use, including the misuse of prescription drugs, unfortunately is a prevalent problem at 
college and university campuses, and The University of Mississippi has not been spared.  The 
University unequivocally prohibits the use and possession of drugs on its campus.  The specifics 
of the drug policy are outlined below. 
 

1. Possession, Use, and Sale of Drugs and Drug Paraphernalia 
a. The University of Mississippi prohibits the use, possession, distribution, sale, 

manufacture, and delivery of illicit drugs including the misuse of prescription 
medications, by members of its community.  Illegal drugs, including prescription 
drugs for which the person does not have a valid prescription, are subject to 
confiscation.   

b. The University of Mississippi also prohibits the possession, sale, and distribution 
of drug paraphernalia (including, but not limited to, pipes, bongs, roach clips, 
rolling papers, etc.).  These items are strictly prohibited and are subject to 
confiscation.  

 
Violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action and students may also be     
subject to criminal prosecution and/or civil liability. 

 
2. The University of Mississippi also prohibits behavior that is a direct result of drug 

consumption, use, or abuse.  Any student found to be visibly overcome by the use of 
drugs will be found in violation of University policy. 

 
3. Information regarding a student’s violation of the University’s drug policy may be 

released to that student’s parents, if the student is under 21 years of age.
