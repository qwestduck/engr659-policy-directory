The University of Mississippi

Relationship to Other IHL Institutions

Summary/Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to define the relationship The University of
Mississippi has to other IHL institutions.

The University of Mississippi serves as the preeminent institution within the IHL system in those
programmatic areas in which it is the sole provider of services (Law, Medicine, Pharmacy,
Dentistry, and some other Health Sciences).  In those areas of academic programming that it
shares with other Comprehensive Universities (Business, Teacher Education, Engineering, etc.),
it provides a program of quality education for students choosing to attend Ole Miss.  The
University also offers programs designed to foster scholarship (Barksdale Honors College),
leadership (Trent Lott Leadership Institute), and an international perspective (Croft International
Study), as well as providing geographic convenience. 

The University extends the instructional and public service activities described above throughout
northern and central Mississippi with degree program offerings in Oxford, Jackson, Tupelo, and
Southaven, while providing more limited instructional services at additional locations in
cooperation with other IHL institutions and community colleges. 

In execution of its core mission, the University cooperates with other IHL institutions as well as
with federal and state agencies in pursuing an active research agenda in the areas of academic
focus identified above.
