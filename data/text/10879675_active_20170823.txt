Outreach Requests 
 

Summary/Purpose:  To describe the guidelines for requesting presentations 

 

The Career Center staff conducts presentations on a variety of career related topics at the request 

of faculty, staff, and campus organizations/groups.  All presentation requests must be made a 

minimum of two weeks in advance of the scheduled date.  To schedule a presentation, contact 

the Career Center at 915.7174. 

 

Based on the amount of research required for special topics, the Career Center may require 

advance notice beyond the two-week timeframe when a presentation request is unique to a 

department or campus organization/group.
