Common Area Damages and Group Billing 
 
Summary/Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to define common areas in residential facilities and the 
procedure for group billing. 
 
Common areas are lobbies, hallways, lounges, recreation rooms, public bathrooms, kitchens, elevators, and 
any other spaces shared by all residents of a facility. Residents may be liable for damages that occur to 
university property within their residential facilities.  
 
Room or common area damage may result in the reassignment or cancellation of the housing contract(s) of 
the person(s) found to be responsible. If responsibility cannot be determined, the entire community may 
share the cost of the damage, whether it occurred in a wing, floor, or entire building.  
 
Damage charges may also be assessed to cover costs resulting from inappropriate behaviors such as setting off 
false fire alarms and stealing university property. Trash/belongings left in the exterior or common areas of the 
building will be removed immediately, and cleaning charges may be assessed without prior notice.  
 
Faulty equipment and damages should be immediately reported to a student housing staff member. Residents 
should not try to make any repairs to facilities as this often increases the cost of the final repairs.  
 
Once damage is reported to a staff member, the Area Coordinator will have two business days to process the 
damage report.  Maintenance will then assess the damage and estimate the costs. Residents will be notified 
that charges may be placed on their bursar accounts within ten business days of submission of the initial 
report.  

Common area damage charges are made up of the labor, materials, and administrative expenses required to 
correct unusual cleaning or damage situations. These charges may be appealed as outlined in the damage 
billing appeal process.
