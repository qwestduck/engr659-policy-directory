Career Advising Appointments 
 

Summary/Purpose:   To define University Career Center procedures for scheduling career 

advising/counseling appointments. 

 

Currently enrolled (undergraduate and graduate) or readmitted students may schedule individual 

appointments with Career Center staff to discuss issues that relate to career development.  

Exploring students can receive assistance with self awareness activities, major selection, and 

career decisions. Students who are declared majors and considering a change to a different 

academic program are advised to visit the Career Center as well.  Through individual 

appointments, staff can assist students with career exploration, decision-making, and job search 

strategies.  All information disclosed by students is confidential and cannot be released, except in 

the following cases:   

 

1. The student is believed to be a threat to self or others. 
2. The student provides information concerning the abuse of a minor or vulnerable 

adult. 

3. The student’s records are subpoenaed by a court of law. 
4. The student willingly signs an information release form. 

  

Appointments are scheduled Monday-Friday during office hours (8:00 am – 5:00 pm).   Requests 

should be made at least 24 hours in advance.
