UM Transmittal Sheet for Funding Requests to External Sponsors 
 

Summary/Purpose:  All requests to external sponsors for funding to support research and 
scholarly or creative activities must be processed through the UM Office of Research and 
Sponsored Programs using the UM Transmittal Sheet. 
 
 
The Principal Investigator/Project Director (or his/her designee) of a sponsored project must 
seek, secure, and substantiate the University’s commitment to all relevant issues of compliance, 
support, and concurrence with fiscal and programmatic statements during a proposal’s develop-
ment.  To do so, the PI/PD must ensure that the proposal conforms to the University’s policies, 
mission, and obligations; must inform relevant administrators of potential commitments of time 
and resources and obtain their written consent to these commitments; and must document the 
University’s compliance with applicable regulations. 
 
The UM Transmittal Sheet for Sponsored Projects is the official university form for the 
documentation of concurrence of university officials with all plans and commitments contained 
in proposals for externally funded programs. 
 
The Office of Research and Sponsored Programs (ORSP) reviews the accuracy and completeness 
of the University’s support of the proposed project and the University’s suitability as a recipient 
of the targeted award.  The ORSP reviews proposals for completeness of the UM Transmittal 
Sheet and compliance with university and agency regulations, including budget review and 
approval.  Upon approval of the proposal, budget, and transmittal sheet, ORSP officials sign the 
UM Transmittal Sheet. 
 
The UM Transmittal Sheet must be completed and approved by the ORSP for all sponsored 
projects for which external funds are sought or received by the University. 
 
The UM Transmittal Sheet must be submitted to the ORSP in a timely, accurate, and complete 
fashion at least five working days in advance of final proposal submission by the University to 
the potential sponsor.
