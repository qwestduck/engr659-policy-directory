Student Health Service Fees 
 

Summary/Purpose: To establish the fees charged to students for services at the Student 
Health Service. 
 
 
The Student Health Service strives to maintain fees at a reasonable level to avoid creating 
a financial barrier for patients. There is no fee for visits for acute care, education or 
counseling.  Fees are divided into special visit fees and ancillary service fees. 
 
 
Special Visit Fees 
 
A minimal charge for visits will be made to students who are not presently enrolled but 
who have completed the previous semester and plan to enroll the next semester. 
 
A visit charge will be made for performing physical examinations and completing forms. 
 
Visit fees for special program participants are by arrangement with the Student Health 
Service. 
 
 
Ancillary Service Fees 
 
Fees are charged for laboratory, X-ray, procedures and supplies. 
 
 
Filing of Insurance Claims 
 
Insurance will be filed at the patient’s request. If the insurance plan pays Student Health 
Service, we will credit the student’s bursar account. Please note that filing an insurance 
claim does not guarantee that benefits will be paid.
