Relinquishing Receipts and Other Documentation 
 

Summary/Purpose:  All procurement card documentation is sent to the Office of Procurement 

Services on a timely basis. 

 

 

A. On Monday of the first week, an email is sent to the departmental administrator.  On 

Friday of the same week, the printed email and all related receipts are due in the Office of 

Procurement Services.   

B. On Monday of the second week, a reminder will be sent to the departmental administrator 

for all documents that have not been received.  

C. On Friday of the second week, a temporary hold will be placed on all delinquent accounts.  

The card will remain on hold for a period of 30 days from the date the document and all 

related receipts are received.  A notice of this hold will be sent to the departmental 

administrator as well as his/her department head.  

D. On Friday of the third week, if documentation is still outstanding, the account will be 

closed.  Once the documentation is received, there will be a 90-day waiting period before the 

department may petition to have its account reinstated.  

If a department’s VISA account is placed on hold (3) three different times, their card will be 

suspended for (90) ninety days.  The department will have to petition to have their card 

reinstated at the end of the ninety-day period.  Procurement Services must be contacted if there 

are unforeseen circumstances causing a delay in the processing of a department’s VISA 

document, so that problems may be addressed before an account is placed on hold.
