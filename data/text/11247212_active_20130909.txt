Summer Pay Policy for Regular Faculty 

 
Tenured and tenure track faculty members who are not employed on a twelve-month contract are 

allowed to earn compensation in addition to academic year salary for work performed between 

the end of the spring semester and the beginning of the fall semester (note: this period begins the 

Monday after spring commencement and ends on the last weekday before the first day of the 9 

month faculty contract).   

 

Faculty can earn pay by teaching, conducting research, or working on sponsored activities.  The 

maximum number of classes that a regular faculty member may teach during the summer is four 

three-hour courses (or equivalent).  Deans of the schools or College may impose a more 

restrictive limit.  The following types of courses offered during this time will count towards this 

maximum allowed number: 

 

 May Intersession courses (all campuses) 

 August Intersession courses (all campuses)   

 Oxford Summer courses (includes Full Term, First Term, and Second Term) 

 Southaven, Tupelo, and Booneville Summer courses (includes Full Term, First Term, 
and Second Term) 

 Ole Miss Online Courses 

 Teacher Workshops for credit  

 Study Abroad courses 
 

Nine month faculty teaching less than full-time during the summer may be paid for research or 

sponsored activities at their academic year rate for the portion of their time they are not teaching.  

For example, an individual teaching half-time during a particular summer term would be allowed 

to earn up to an additional 50 percent pay during that period, calculated at his/her academic year 

salary rate on a daily basis.  A full-time teaching load during any of the above terms is defined in 

the following ways: for one of the intersessions, one three-hour course; for the first or second 

summer term, two three-hour courses with the possible addition of a one-hour related lab; 

courses taught over the first and second summer terms are counted in part and evenly for each 

term; courses that are less than three hours make a partial contribution to the full-time teaching 

load.   

 

This policy has no effect on salary per class amounts paid from the Summer Session budget.
