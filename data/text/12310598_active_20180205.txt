3. All external doors are protected against unauthorized entry with control mechanisms (e.g., 
alarms, locks etc.). 

4. Doors to internal secure areas (e.g., data center, communications closets, etc.) make use of 
additional security measures as deemed appropriate by the Chief Information Security 
Officer (CISO). Examples of additional security measures include automatic locks, door delay

every 90 days. 

5. Where feasible, UM enforces physical access controls and maintains an audit trail of all 
access according to the Audit, Logging, and Monitoring Policy. 

6. Third party support personnel are granted restricted access to secure areas. This access 
must be authorized and monitored. 

7. All physical access devices (e.g., keys, access cards, combinations, etc.) must be returned, 
disabled, or changed when access is no longer authorized. 

8. UM inventories physical access devices annually.

or heat activated) are installed, protected and maintained according to applicable laws and 
regulations. 

F. Equipment Siting and Protection 

1. Information assets are physically located to minimize potential damage from physical and 
environmental threats and hazards, and to minimize the opportunities for unauthorized 
access. 

2. Guidelines for eating, drinking, and smoking in proximity to information assets are 
established. 

3. Hazardous or combustible materials are stored at a safe distance from a secure area. 

4. Bulk supplies such as printer paper, etc. are not stored within a secure area.

5. Backup information assets and media are stored at a safe distance from the main site to 
avoid damage from disaster affecting the main site. 

6. Where feasible, lightning protection is applied to all buildings, and lightning protection 
filters (e.g., surge protectors) are fitted to all incoming power and communications lines. 

7. Where feasible, information assets processing confidential data are positioned, and the 
viewing angle restricted, to reduce the risk of information being viewed by unauthorized 
persons. 

8. Where deemed appropriate by the CISO, device locks (e.g., slot locks, port controls, 
peripheral switch controls, cable traps, etc.) are implemented for information assets 
containing confidential data. 

9. Where feasible, UM restricts physical access to wireless access points, networking and 
communications hardware, and telecommunication lines. 

G. Supporting Utilities 

1. Information assets supporting critical business operations are protected from power failures 
and other disruptions caused by failures in supporting utilities (e.g., electricity, water supply, 
steam pipes, sewage, heating/ventilation, and air conditioning). 

2. All supporting utilities are adequate for the systems they are supporting. 

3. Supporting utilities are regularly inspected and tested to ensure their proper functioning 
and to reduce any risk from malfunction or failure. 

4. A suitable electrical supply is provided that conforms to the equipment manufacturer's 
specifications. 

5. An uninterruptable power supply (UPS) is required for information assets that support 
critical business operations to support orderly close down or transition to generators. 

6. Power contingency plans cover the action to be taken on failure of the UPS.

recommendations to ensure they have adequate capacity. 

8. The water supply is stable and adequate to supply air conditioning, humidification 
equipment, and fire suppression systems. 

H. Cabling Security
