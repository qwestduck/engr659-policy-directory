Inventory Requirements 
 

Summary/Purpose:  State requirements for inventory items. 

 

 

1. Primary Inventory  

Primary inventory includes all equipment purchases of $1,000.00 or more (and all exception 

items) that are required to be numbered and included on the property inventory list of any 

department and reported to the State Property Office.  It is the responsibility of the University 

Property Office to attach labels to all primary inventory items in areas where they can be readily 

seen without having to move the item for identification.  It is the responsibility of the department 

chairperson or his/her designee to assist the Property Office in identifying and labeling these 

items. The University label shall remain on the equipment until it has been decommissioned by 

the Property Office.  Removal of a University label by anyone other than the Property Office is 

prohibited. 

2. Secondary Inventory  

Secondary inventory includes all other equipment, furniture, etc., costing less than $1,000.00 and 

not required to be included on the departmental equipment inventory.  These items will be 

identified with a red label stating “Property of The University of Mississippi”.  Although these 

items are not accounted for through the State Property Office, department chairs are responsible 

for keeping up with this equipment and should use the same procedures when loaning or 

disposing of these items.
