Equipment Acquisition â€“ Surplus/Jackson 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Accounting for the acquisition of surplus property. 

 

 

Equipment items acquired through Mississippi Surplus Property Commission having a fair 

market value of $1000 or more (and those items as required on the exception list) shall be added 

to the inventory list of the department. It is the responsibility of the Procurement Services 

Department to provide the University Property Office with a copy of the purchase receipt from 

surplus property. Items of equipment acquired through Surplus Property are added at the fair 

market price not the purchase price of the item.
