Explosive Materials Disposal 
 

Summary/Purpose:  The Explosive Materials Disposal Policy details the minimum 
requirements and procedures for the safe packaging, removal and disposal of potentially 
explosive materials. 
 

Explosive Materials Disposal 

Definition of Explosives 
 
Explosives are a class of materials, either solids or liquids that can undergo a rapid chemical 
decomposition when subject to an external force (shock, friction, sparks, etc.)  
 
The rate of decomposition across the explosive material travels faster than the speed of sound, 
and produces large amount of heat and gas.  
 
The amount of energy required to initiate this chemical reaction determines the sensitivity and 
stability of the explosive material.  
 
There are several common laboratory reagents that can become unstable or explosive. Factors 
that can transform common reagents into explosives may be as simple as extended storage time, 
increased storage temperatures, or allowing a material to dry out.  

What Happens if I Locate an Explosive Material? 

Whenever you find of suspect that you have found a potentially explosive material, DO NOT 
MOVE THE CONTAINER.  
 
Post a sign, and alert personnel in your area of your discovery. CONTACT Laboratory Services 
(LS) (915) - 5433.  
 
If a peroxidized compound (see list below) forms within a screw cap bottle, some of the 
potentially explosive material may rest within the threads inside the cap. Unscrewing the cap 
may initiate an explosion.  

 When a material is identified as explosive, LS must take specific precautions to 
o Remove the material from high traffic areas, 
o Transport the material away from personnel or buildings, and, 
o Stabilize, Dilute or detonate the material. 

 Additional State and Federal requirements come into play when dealing with explosive 
materials. 

 Removal and/or disposal may take an extended period of time to complete. 
 Please be patient. 
 We are concerned for your safety, as well as for our own.

  Peroxides are an extremely sensitive byproduct formed when a compound reacts with air.  
   

Chemicals that form explosive levels of peroxides without concentration: 

Butadiene a 

Chloroprene a  

Divinylacetylene 

Isopropryl ether 

Tetrafiuoroethylene 

Vinylidene chloride 

Chemicals that form explosive levels of peroxides on concentration: 

Acetal Acetaldehyde   
Benzyl alcohol   
2-Butane   
Cumerie   
Cyclohexanol   
2-Cyclohexen-1-ol

a    When stored as a liquid monomer.   

b    Although these chemicals form peroxides, no explosion involving these monomers have 
been reported.   

c    When stored in liquid form, these chemicals form explosive levels of peroxides without 
concentration. They may also be stored as a gas in gas cylinders. When stored as a gas, these 
chemicals may autopolymerize as a result of peroxide accumulation.   

d    These chemicals easily form peroxides and should probably be considered under part B.   

e    Regulated carcinogen.   

f     Extremely reactive and unstable compounds.
