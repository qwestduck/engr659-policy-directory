Noise Level Violations
 
DSA.SC.200.070
 

Summary/Purpose: To promote academic freedom by preventing disruptions to the University 
community from unreasonable noise or sound levels. 

The University of Mississippi restricts noise or sound, whether amplified or not, that causes a 
disturbance to reasonable persons in the area, disrupts the academic, research or service activities 
or mission of the University, or disrupts any activity or event of the University community.  
There may be places and times at the University where this policy is more restrictive, i.e., within 
the residence halls during quiet hours.  Whether a warning is given for such a violation is at the 
discretion of the University official addressing the situation. 

Amplified Sound on Campus 

There shall be no outdoor amplified sound at any gathering, social or other event unless it is a 
University of Mississippi sponsored activity or it is approved by the Office of the Dean of 
Students, Student Programming Board, or other University administrative office.  The University 
of Mississippi prohibits the disruption or disturbance of the University community by 
unreasonably loud amplified sound. Any initial violation of this policy will result in a warning to 
conform to the appropriate sound level, and a second violation will result in disciplinary action.
