BUILDING ACCESS 

 

Summary/Purpose: This policy explains Student Housing’s expectations regarding authorized and 

unauthorized access into the residence halls.  

 

All residents and their guests should enter and exit the residence halls through the front door adjacent to 

the desk area. Video surveillance cameras exist at some residence hall entrances and residents and their 

guests may be videotaped upon entering or exiting the buildings. Only in case of an emergency should 

emergency exits be used. Persons should never enter or exit the building through a window unless there 

is an emergency. To ensure that emergency exits are used appropriately, the following policies have been 

established:  

 Residents found with their window security grates open are subject to disciplinary action and will 
be fined $100 for each violation. Window security grates are to remain closed and locked unless 

there is an emergency.  

 Residents found exiting through an alarm-activated residence hall exit door, when there is no 
emergency, are subject to disciplinary action and will be fined at least $25 for the first instance 

and at least $50 for each succeeding violation.  

 Residents found exiting onto the roof of a residence hall are subject to disciplinary action and 
will be fined $100 for each violation.  

 Residents found in halls while they are closed for break periods are subject to University judicial 
action and possible expulsion from the residence halls.  

 Roofs are off limits to non-authorized personnel.
