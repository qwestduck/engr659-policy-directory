Budget Escalations and Revisions 
 

Summary/Purpose:  All requests for escalations and revisions to university departmental 
budgets, permanent and temporary, must be submitted to the Budget Office for approval. The 
Budget Office will submit requests for approval, as required, to the Commissioner of Higher 
Education and the Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning. This policy does 
not apply to designated and restricted funds.  
 
Permanent budget revisions may be requested each spring during the operating budget process or 
at any time during the year by submitting a Request for Budget Revision (e-form 22) through the 
appropriate administrative channels. Permanent budget revisions affect the fiscal year for which  
submitted, as well as future fiscal years. 
  
Temporary budget revisions may be requested at any time during the year by submitting a 
Request for Budget Revision (e-form 22) through the appropriate administrative channels. 
Temporary budget revisions only affect the fiscal year for which submitted.  
 
All escalations to annual budgets of the institution and separately budgeted units must be 
submitted to the Budget Office for approval. The Budget Office will submit such requests to the 
IHL Board through the Commissioner of Higher Education for approval prior to implementation. 
 
All realignments, or revisions to the annual budgets which do not increase the total amount of the 
budgets, must be submitted to the Budget Office for approval. The Budget Office will submit 
such requests to the Commissioner of Higher Education for approval prior to implementation and 
subsequent reporting to the IHL Board.
