Career Assessments 
 

Summary/Purpose:  To define guidelines for requesting career assessments 

 

The Career Center offers career assessment services for students and alumni, namely TypeFocus, 

the Strong Interest Inventory, and the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).  TypeFocus is 

offered at no charge, the Strong Interest Inventory and the MBTI are offered at a nominal fee 

(contact the Career Center for a fee schedule).  Students or alumni who wish to take these on-line 

assessments to help resolve career planning issues will be referred to a Career Center staff 

member for individual assistance.   

 

The initial appointment will last approximately one hour, to determine the consumerâ€™s needs 

prior to administration of the assessment and to determine whether an assessment would benefit 

the consumer.  If the Career Center Staff determines that an assessment would be beneficial, 

instructions will be provided for accessing the on-line assessment, and an additional appointment 

will be scheduled at a later date for interpretation of the results.  Appointment requests should be 

made at least 24 hours in advance.
