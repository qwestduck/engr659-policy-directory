Departmental Inventory 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Certain specialized operations within a department or isolated area away 
from the parent office may be established as an individual entity as far as property accountability 
is concerned. 
 
 
 
The smaller the inventory unit, the easier it is to control.  Departments desiring to do this should 
notify the Property Office by memo of their intentions as well as, departmental contacts, so they 
can assist in identifying the equipment utilized by the special operation and in transferring them 
to a separate property listing. Ultimate responsibility for inventories of these individual entities 
will fall on the departmental chairperson. No department has the authority to do this without first 
contacting the Property Office.
