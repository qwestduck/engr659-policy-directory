The University of Mississippi 

Full-time State Employment 

Summary/Purpose:  An explanation is given as to when a person can be employed by The 
University if they are employed full time by another agency of the State of Mississippi.  

 It is the policy of the University not to employ anyone who is employed full time by another 
agency of the State of Mississippi. Before the University can, with propriety, employ a full-time 
state employee, it will be necessary to determine from the other state agency whether the 
employee must devote full time to his/her work.
