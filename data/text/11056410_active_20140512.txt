Waiver Request 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Request authority to pay approved University business related travel 

expenses greater than the state guidelines allow. 

 

The Waiver Request Form is required to request a waiver from any standard travel procedures.  

This form should be completely filled out, signed by your department head and submitted for 

approval to Procurement Services.  This should be done prior to making any reservations or 

commitments.   

 

A clear explanation and necessary information should be provided that would prove the request 

to be economical or otherwise in the best interest of the state. Failure to provide adequate 

information will cause delay and may potentially cause a rejection of the request. 

 

Approval of the Waiver Request form will depend on Procurement Services being able to clearly 

determine the anticipated cost to the state and/or any anticipated savings.  All applicable cost 

information, such as contract fare, lowest available fare, conference hotel rate, actual rate paid, 

etc., should be provided. 

 

The following is a list of possible reasons a Waiver Request Form may be needed: 

 

 Requesting authority to pay an amount greater than the state contract. 

 Requesting authority to rent a vehicle with a cost greater than the intermediate size on state 
contract. 

 Requesting authority to purchase vehicle rental insurance. 

 Requesting authority to rent a vehicle not on state contract. 

 Requesting authority to pay a hotel other than the conference hotel. 

 Requesting authority to pay greater than the least expensive cost comparison for airline 
tickets. 

 Requesting authority to purchase business or first class airfare.
