Safety 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Safety regulations must be enforced, observed and unsafe conditions and 
practices should be reported.  Included is an explanation of how Workerâ€™s Compensation is 
provided for those who are injured while on duty. 
 
Safety regulations along with all other precautions normally expected must be enforced by alert 
supervision.  However, all employees can do much to make a campus a better place to work by 
observing safety regulations and reporting unsafe conditions and practices.  Workers' 
Compensation is provided for those who are injured while on duty.  Although the prevention of 
injury and the loss of property are first considerations, emphasis may also be given to the fact 
that Workers' Compensation premiums are calculated on the basis of injuries anticipated and 
subsequently adjusted by an "experience factor," which reflects the frequency and severity of 
accidents over a period of time.
