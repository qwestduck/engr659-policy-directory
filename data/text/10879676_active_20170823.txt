On-Campus Recruiting 
 

Summary/Purpose:  To define the guidelines for participation in on-campus interviews with 

prospective employers who visit the Career Center. 

 

 

The on-campus recruiting program is designed to assist full-time/internship job seekers in 

making a connection with prospective employers. This service is reserved for currently enrolled 

students and alumni (by employer request only). To ensure efficient operation of this service, 

participants are required to adhere to the following: 

 

1. Read and understand the On-Campus Recruiting Policy, located in the student 
“Resource” section of the Handshake career management system. 

2. Complete the profile section, in its entirety, on Handshake and upload a current resume 
into the user’s account. 

3. Check the Handshake account, daily, to obtain the most recent listing of interview 
schedules.  Career Center staff may post announcements, changes and new career 

opportunities at any time. 

4. It is the responsibility of the student to adhere to the deadline dates of each scheduled 
on-campus recruiting event posted on Handshake. 

5. Scheduled interview times may only be changed or cancelled up to 48 hours prior to the 
event. 

 

No-Show Policy 

 

1. If a student fails to show for a self-selected interview time, his or her interview privileges 
will be suspended immediately. 

2. Privileges may be considered for reinstatement with:  a.) a valid medical or family 
emergency statement presented in person by the student to the designated Career Center 

staff member; and b.) a written letter of apology to the employer.
