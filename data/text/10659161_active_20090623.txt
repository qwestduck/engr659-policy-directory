Injury Leave 
 

Summary/Purpose:  An employee may use accumulated paid time off in the event he/she is 
injured in the course of employment and is required to be absent from work. 
 
When an employee is injured in the course of employment he/she is entitled to benefits under the 
provisions of Workers' Compensation, which is provided by the University for all personnel.  An 
employee may use Major Medical (sick) Leave or earned Personal (vacation) Leave to cover a 
portion of his/her period of absence from duty to the extent of his/her full  accumulated leave, as 
defined by state law.  State law mandates that an employee’s total compensation as a 
combination of paid leave and workers’ compensation indemnity payments cannot exceed 100% 
of regular compensation.  Personnel may be placed on leave without pay if no Major Medical 
(sick) Leave or Personal (vacation) Leave has been accrued.
