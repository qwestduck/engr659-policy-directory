Voice Mail 
 

Summary/Purpose: Define the use of voice mail on telephones. 
 

• BETWEEN 8:00 A.M. AND 5:00 P.M., VOICE MAIL IS NOT TO BE USED ON 
DEPARTMENTAL NUMBERS ON CAMPUS.  

o In those departments that are understaffed, your Vice Chancellor may grant 
special permission for use of Voice Mail when no one is available to cover the 
phones. Examples are shown below:  

 The department does not employ a full time secretary.  
 The department employs only one secretary or receptionist. Voice Mail 

may be used when the secretary or receptionist has to be away from the 
desk for an extended period.  

• VOICE MAIL MAY BE USED DURING THE NORMAL WORKDAY FOR 
MESSAGES ON PERSONAL NUMBERS ONLY IF THE INDIVIDUAL HAS TO BE 
AWAY FROM THE DESK.  

o Faculty and others who are in "one-person" offices may find it desirable to 
activate voice mail when they are away from their offices.  

• VOICE MAIL MAY BE USED AFTER HOURS OR WHEN THE UNIVERSITY IS 
CLOSED FOR WEATHER, HOLIDAYS, ETC.  

o The Telecommunications Center can set up Voice Mail so employees can activate 
it themselves for holiday periods and weekends. They will also set up Voice Mail 
so that employees can deactivate it during the regular workday. The 
Telecommunications Center provides this service and all other Voice Mail 
services at no cost to the departments or individuals.  

• VOICE MAIL WILL NOT BE USED TO AVOID ANSWERING THE PHONE.  
o A major complaint about voice mail is that people "hide" behind it to avoid 

answering the telephone.  
• VOICE MAIL GREETINGS SHOULD BE PROFESSIONAL AND SHOULD 

REPRESENT THE UNIVERSITY WELL.  
o Always give a caller the option of leaving a message or being transferred to a 

"live" person.
