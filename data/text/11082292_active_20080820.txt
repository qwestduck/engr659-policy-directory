The University of Mississippi 

The Creed 
 

Summary/Purpose:  To outline certain established values that each member of the University 
community should strive to possess.   
 
 
Students at The University of Mississippi have the responsibility to uphold the Creed of the 
University.  The Creed is the umbrella under which all of the rights, responsibilities, rules, and 
regulations are based.  Although no University judicial action will be taken based exclusively on 
the Creed, as the Creed is the spirit of all our other policies, action may be taken if conduct 
violates those policies.
