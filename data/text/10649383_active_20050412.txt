Access to Students’ Educational Records

The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA or the Buckley
Amendment) is a federal law which governs access to the students’ education records. This law
grants students guaranteed access to their educational records; such access includes the right to
inspect and review educational records, the right to obtain copies of the records (a copying fee
may be charged), and the right to challenge or supplement information on file in order to prevent
flawed interpretation. Certain records (i.e., medical records) are not deemed to be educational
records and are therefore not accessible to students. Additionally, the Buckley Amendment
prohibits the disclosure of “personally identifiable information” to third parties without the prior
written consent of the student. Exceptions may be made only for University officials and others
with legitimate educational interests. The University may disclose “directory information” unless
the student notifies the University to the contrary. Directory information is defined as a student’s
name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date and place of birth, major field of study,
student activities, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees
and awards received, and the most previous educational agency or institution attended by the
student. If you have questions about the law or want more information, please contact the Office
of the Registrar at (662) 915-7226.
