Summary/Purpose: To preserve the respect and dignity for each person and maintain an 

open and diverse environment by prohibiting conduct that threatens the safety of others. 

 

 

Students will demonstrate respect for the dignity of each person by refraining from conduct 

that physically harms, or attempts to harm, another. Examples of behavior that are 

inconsistent with this value include, but are not limited to, the following: purposely, 

knowingly, or recklessly causing, or attempting to cause, bodily harm to another; purposely, 

knowingly, or recklessly placing another in fear of serious bodily harm; and intentional, 
reckless, or negligent conduct that threatens, or endangers, the health or safety of others. 

Students who act inconsistently with this value and policy will be subject to conduct charges 

and proceedings. 

 

In addition to the University conduct process, the University of Mississippi provides a 

mechanism to address grievances that may arise over sexual harassment (including sexual 

assault and relationship violence) or alleged discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, 

veteranâ€™s status, age, national origin, or disability as prohibited by Title VI and VII of the 

Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, and Sections 503 

and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Incidents of harassment should be reported to the 

Office of Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct and/or the Office of Equal Employment 

and Regulatory Compliance.
