Reemployment after Retirement 

Summary/Purpose:  Regulations are given for the reemployment of retired University 
employees. This includes criteria for such reemployment and the determination of the rate of pay 
for faculty and staff. 

Retired University employees may be reemployed in accordance with the policies of the Public 
Employees' Retirement System to perform related duties. Such employment relationships should 
not continue for an indefinite period of time and should not be viewed as "part-time jobs" after 
retirement.  

The criteria for such employment must be its benefit to the University and cost effectiveness. 
Factors to be considered are the need for a special skill or skills which the retiree possesses, the 
need for the training of a replacement, and the scarcity of such skill(s) in the employment area.  

The rate of pay received by retired staff employees may be the rate the employee was earning at 
the time of retirement if reemployed to perform the same job. In other instances, the rate will be 
established in accordance with "new hire flexibility" provisions of the Variable Compensation 
Plan (VCP), if a classified position. If not classified, the rate will be based upon a competitive 
rate for the work performed determined in conjunction with the Department of Human 
Resources.

The compensation rate for retired faculty members will be determined by the duties performed 
by the retiree and will normally be less than the salary rate at the time of retirement.
