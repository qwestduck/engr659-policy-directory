State Travel Agencies 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Travel agencies contracted by the State for employee business travel. 
 
 
The Office of Procurement Services has identified the approved list of Travel Agencies to 
provide travel services to university employees.  
 
Employees may have travel arrangements handled by one of the contracted agencies whenever 
traveling on official University business by airline or other common carrier or may make 
arrangements through methods of their own choice. A fee is charged when utilizing the services 
provided by the state travel agencies.  The traveler will receive a confirmation of travel 
accommodations arranged by the state travel agency. A copy of the confirmation must be 
attached to the Travel Reimbursement Voucher when it is filed. 
 
You must identify yourself as a University of Mississippi employee.  The traveler is responsible 
for ensuring that the travel agency provides you with the state contract rate.
