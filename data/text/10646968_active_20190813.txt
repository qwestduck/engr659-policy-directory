Termination of Untenured Faculty 

 
This section applies only to faculty in non-temporary positions. Untenured 

faculty shall be support and research faculty at all ranks and tenure-track 

faculty during their probationary period. 

 

Contracts for those who hold the rank of Instructor are renewable at the 

discretion of the University, with no advance notice of separation of 

employment.  All other untenured faculty members who are not to be continued 

shall ordinarily be given notice of separation of employment not later than 

three months before the expiration date of their contract in the first year of 

service; not later than six months before the expiration of their contract in the 

second year of service; and not later than twelve months before the expiration 

of their appointment after two or more years of service.  

 

Untenured faculty members dismissed for reasons of financial exigencies, 

termination or reduction of programs, or termination of academic or 

administrative units shall be given at least a 30-day notice.  

 

Untenured faculty members dismissed for malfeasance, inefficiency, or 

contumacious conduct or for cause shall have their contracts terminated at any 

time. If it is proposed to dismiss an untenured faculty member for above 

reasons prior to the expiration of the contract term, the same procedures will 

be followed as outlined for the termination of a tenured faculty member.
