Internet Protocol (IP) Telephony 

Summary/Purpose: Defines the use of IP Telephony 

The following policy applies to IP Telephony. 

The University maintains a telephone and long distance system to permit University business and 

provide an online accountability interface for auditing purposes.  The Mississippi Department of 

Information Technology Services has statutory oversight of IT and telecommunications 

procurements for all state agencies, including the IHLs.  Their opinion is that Skype and other 

such services are not a suitable substitute for business-class telephone service for state agencies. 

Under special circumstances exceptions can be obtained through the University 

Telecommunications Center.
