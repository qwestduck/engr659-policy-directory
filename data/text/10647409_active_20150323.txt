Damage Appeals 
 

Summary/Purpose:  This policy explains the appeal procedure students must use to request a 
refund on charges placed on their Bursar’s account for damage-related reasons.  
Damage appeals are investigated and reviewed on an ongoing basis by at least two members of 
the Residence Life staff.  Common-area damage charges cannot be appealed unless extenuating 
circumstances exist or the identity of the person(s) responsible is established. 
Residents who wish to appeal charges placed on their student account may write a formal letter 
of appeal:  

Damage Appeals Process c/o Student Housing and Residence Life P.O. Box 1848 
University, MS 38677-1848.  

Damage appeals are investigated and reviewed on an ongoing basis by at least two members of

 • Mailing address
