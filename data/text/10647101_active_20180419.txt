Procedure for Filling Support Staff Position Vacancies 

 
Summary/Purpose: This procedure is to be followed when filling support staff positions.  

These positions are listed with the University Employment Office which provides employment 

support in the selection and referral of applicants.  

 

All support staff openings at The University of Mississippi are listed with the University 

Employment Office which provides employment support in the selection and referral of 

applicants to fill position vacancies. Office hours are Monday - Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 

p.m.  

 

PROCEDURE - All vacancies are listed electronically through the University’s online 

employment system. Designees on campus initiate the personnel requisitions and submit the 

requisition for approval. The Employment Office processes the personnel requisition and 

provides the final approval. An e-mail containing the link for the Search Committee Guide is 

sent to the members of the search committee. This guide may also be found at the home page of 

the online employment system. 

 

The Employment Office then reviews the application materials for non-exempt (hourly) staff 

positions and screens the application materials to ensure the applicants meet the minimum 

qualifications. If the minimum qualifications are met, the application is referred electronically to 

the administrators/search committees associated with the personnel requisition. If the minimum 

qualifications are not met, the applicant’s status is updated to “Not Referred by HR.”  

 

APPLICATION – Internal and external applicants interested in support staff positions at the 

University must complete and submit an application online.
