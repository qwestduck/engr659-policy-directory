BREAK PERIODS 

 

Purpose/Summary: This policy explains the residence hall closing times for fall, semester, 

and spring breaks. The policy also discusses potential ramifications students face if they do 

not follow these expectations.  

 

The residence halls close for fall break, mid-year break, and spring break at 10:00 a.m. following 

the last day of classes or finals prior to each break. Alternate housing is available for students 

during these break periods. Halls remain open for Good Friday and Easter; however, food service 

options may not be available. Consult the notices that are posted during these times for more 

information. Students must vacate their rooms within 24 hours of their last final or at 10:00 a.m. 

for semester closing, whichever comes first. Students who do not vacate their rooms within the 

stated time frame will be assessed a fee per hour for every hour they stay after the official closing 

of the halls. Residents found in the halls while they are closed are subject to University judicial 

sanctions. It is important that students remove items they may need during the hall closing 

period. Should the staff be asked to open a hall due to a student forgetting an item, a charge will 

be assessed to the student.
