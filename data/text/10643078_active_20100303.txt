Personal Long Distance Authorization Codes  

Summary/Purpose: Defines the acquisition and use of a personal long distance authorization 
code.  

A faculty or staff member can get a personal authorization code to make long distance calls. The 
long distance charges are processed through our accounting system and charges are automatically 
deducted from the paycheck. The personal authorization code can be obtained by submitting a 
request by SAP, by e-mail, or by sending a memo to the Telecommunications Center requesting the 
code. This code MUST NOT be used for University business. It is suggested that personal calls be 
made before or after normal working hours.  

Employees can access long distance billing detail via their myOleMiss account and print out a 
copy of the monthly call detail for long distance calls. It is important that each individual check 
their listing to find out if they and not someone else made all calls on the report. If suspicion arises 
that an authorization code is being used illegally, please notify the Telecommunications Center 
immediately and it will be removed from service  

Personal authorization codes should be safeguarded. If you think that a code has been 
compromised, please contact the Telecommunications Center immediately. The code will be 
deactivated and a new one will be assigned.
