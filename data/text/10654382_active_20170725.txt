Summary/Purpose:  To define University Counseling Center eligibility for students. 

 

University Counseling Center services are available to all currently enrolled students at the 

University of Mississippi.  Students also are eligible for services in the summer if they 

completed the previous semester and are enrolled in the next Fall semester.  Students at 

satellite campuses are eligible for services, but must travel to the Oxford campus to receive 

services.
