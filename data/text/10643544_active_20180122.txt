Freshmen Required to Purchase Meal Plan 

Summary/Purpose:  States requirement meal plans 

 

All freshmen assessed for housing are required to purchase a semester meal plan 

BOTH Fall and Spring semesters of their freshman year, regardless of Greek 

affiliation.  If a meal plan is not selected, the minimum required meal plan will be 

automatically assessed. The RC Unlimited Plus One meal plan is required for all 

residents of the Residential College, regardless of classification. 

Freshmen who are a part of a group or activity such as a fraternity or sorority that 

requires participation in a separate meal program may purchase a Greek meal 

plan, offered in the spring semester only. 

For a list of meal plans, including those that meet the resident freshman 

requirement, visit www.olemissdining.com, and select the “meal plans/freshman 

resident meal plans” tabs.
