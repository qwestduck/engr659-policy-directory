Encouraging the development and use of IDPs (Individual 

Development Plans) for PhD Graduate Students and Post Docs 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Faculty and Research Staff who actively supervise and mentor PhD 

graduate students and Post-Docs are strongly encouraged to support the creation and use of 

Individual Development Plans. 

 

 

An Individual Development Plan (IDP) may be viewed as a customizable roadmap to assist with 

developing a clear pathway toward a successful career.  It includes formulating and establishing 

clear academic and professional goals, and action plans for achieving those goals.  

 

The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) has developed a web-based 

career-planning tool specifically for PhD students and postdocs in the sciences.  This tool 

(http://myidp.sciencecareers.org) is intended to help students and new scientists explore their 

own strengths in the sciences as well as other skills such as leadership and communication, 

matching their talents to potential career options, both traditional and untraditional, within and 

outside of academe.  It specifically engages the faculty mentor and encourages the mentor to 

monitor progress and discuss career goals with the student/post-doc. 

 

Faculty and Research Staff who actively supervise and mentor PhD graduate students and Post-

Docs are strongly encouraged to adopt the use of this or similar career-planning tools.
