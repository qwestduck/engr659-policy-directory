Garbage Disposal for Apartment Residents 
 

Summary/Purpose: This policy describes the procedure for garbage disposal at Campus Walk 
Apartments and Northgate Apartments.  
 
All garbage should be placed in plastic bags, tied securely, and placed inside the dumpster. 
Garbage should not be set on porches, sidewalks, or beside the dumpster, even temporarily. If the 
dumpster is full, residents should use a different one. Garbage left outside of the containers 
invites roaches, rodents, and other animals. Residents are responsible for keeping the grounds 
clean by making sure that all trash is placed in the dumpster and trash around the apartment is 
picked up. If garbage is found in unauthorized places and the responsible resident is identified, 
that resident will be subject to fines and judicial action.
