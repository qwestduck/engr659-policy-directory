The University of Mississippi 

 

Guidelines for Identifying Substantive Changes 
(effective May 1, 2008; updated September 6, 2014) 

 

The University recognizes that substantive changes, as defined by the attached table, 

must be reported in a timely manner to the Commission on Colleges of the Southern 

Association of Schools and Colleges (SACS-CoC).  Also, certain changes must also be 

reported to and approved by the IHL Office prior to implementation. 

 

The University has procedures for the approval of new academic programs, including the 

identification of whether a new program is intended to be delivered off-campus or via 

distance education.  These procedures involve review and approval at the level of the 

department, school/college, Graduate or Undergraduate Council, Council of Academic 

Administrators, and Chancellor, with there being a separate process for seeking approval 

by the IHL Board of Trustees before activation of the program.  This approval process for 

a new program identifies a substantive change situation and allows time for submission 

of information to SACS-CoC.  However, the approval steps have been less clear for 

converting an existing program to an off-campus location or distance education delivery 

mode and the steps for expansion to a new off-campus location.   

 

The purpose of this memorandum is to establish guidelines for identifying substantive 

changes in all cases and in a timely manner. 

 

New Programs:  The approval process for new programs is described in UM Policies 

Procedure for Creating a New Undergraduate Program and Creation, Suspension, 

Deletion and Review of Graduate Programs and IHL document Academic Guidelines.  

The new program request form, which is a part of the Academic Council Workflow, has 

instructions stating that if the program is to be delivered at an off-campus site and/or via 

distance education (or online), is a program at a different level than previously offered, 

involves a contractual arrangement with another institution, is a dual or joint degree 

program with another institution, or is a certificate program, the proposed program should 

be reviewed by the SACS Liaison at the earliest possible time for a determination of 

whether a substantive change notification or prospectus must be submitted to SACS-

COC.  The SACS Liaison will advise the Provost, department chair, and dean proposing 

the program and will work with the latter individuals in preparing the proper notification 

or prospectus. 

  

Converting Existing Programs:  Whereas the above procedures involve approval steps 

for new programs that will identify substantive change situations, the University must 

make a special effort to identify substantive changes that result from the porting of 

existing programs to an off-campus and/or distance education delivery mode.  While 

individual courses might be delivered at off-campus locations or via distance education, 

the key criterion is whether 25% or more of the courses for a degree program credit is 

delivered (for the first time and when no similar program at a given level has previously 

been delivered) to an off-campus site and/or via distance education (including online). 

 



 2 

To identify these situations, the Division of Outreach and Continuing Studies must be the 

principal gate keeping office.  Secondarily, the deans of our schools and college and the 

deans of the off-campus centers must be aware of the criteria for substantive changes.  

The Provost’s Office is ultimately responsible for informing other offices and enforcing the requirements.  

The Division of Outreach and Continuing Studies and the deans are responsible for disclosing to the 

SACS Liaison and Provost any instance where an existing academic program is planned for porting to an 

off-campus location. This disclosure must occur at least eight months before planned implementation.   

 

Creating Online or Distance Education Programs:  Any plan to offer at least 25% of the course work 

for a major program via any distance education modality (online or station-to-station video), through our 

Division of Outreach and Continuing Studies or schools/college, must be disclosed to the SACS Liaison 

and Provost at least eight months before the course is delivered.  

 

New Locations:   Any plan to offer courses at a new physical location, through our Division of Outreach 

and Continuing Studies or schools/college, must be disclosed to the SACS Liaison and Provost at least 

eight months before the first course is to be delivered.  This applies whether the course will be delivered 

in person or via station-to-station video.   

 
Other Reportable Substantive Changes:  In a similar manner, any other potentially reportable substantive 

changes planned by any of the units in the Division of Academic Affairs must be disclosed to the SACS 

Liaison and Provost at least eight months before the action. 

 

Annual Inventory of Programs:  The Provost’s Office will maintain an inventory of programs, 

including the location of their delivery and whether any surpass the 25% and 50% delivery levels.
