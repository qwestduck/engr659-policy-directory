CAMPUS MAIL SERVICES – PERSONAL PACKAGES 
 
 

Summary / Purpose: Delivery of Personal Packages  
 
 
University employees are prohibited from using their departmental work place address 
for the “deliver to address” of personal packages that will be ultimately delivered by 
Campus Mail Services. 
  
Employees, who use their work place address for delivery purposes when placing orders 
for personal items and packages, must set up a personal account with one of the private 
sector package carriers, UPS, FED-EX, etc. to facilitate delivery.  Receiving personal 
packages in campus mail services is counter productive to the sizable investment of 
equipment and human resources located in the campus mail department.   
 
Personal packages received in campus mail will be returned to the company or sender.
