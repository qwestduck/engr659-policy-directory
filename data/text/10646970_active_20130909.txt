Search Committees 

 
The Faculty Senate will be asked to provide representation on all search committees for positions 

that have a direct organizational line to a Vice Chancellor or to the Chancellor. The Faculty 

Senate will be asked to nominate two people from the appropriately related Senate subcommittee 

and the Chancellor will select one. The current procedure of faculty involvement on academic 

search committees will be continued.
