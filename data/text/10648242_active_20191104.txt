Annual Reports of Standing Committees

Summary/Purpose:  The purpose of this policy is to inform all regarding the procedure of
Annual Reports for Standing Committees.  

For the historic record of the University, all standing committee chairs are requested to complete
an annual report in narrative form.  These reports serve as the official record of yearly committee
accomplishments and should be prepared with a great deal of thought and care.  Guidelines and a
list of committees can be found at
