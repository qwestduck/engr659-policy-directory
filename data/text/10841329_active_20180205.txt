BID REQUIREMENT – EXCEPTIONS 

 

Summary/Purpose: To provide for the purchase of commodities, equipment and certain 

services that are exempt from normal bid requirements. 

 

 

When submitting Purchase Requisitions for ordering commodities and/or equipment that 

are covered by mandatory or negotiated state contracts, or for items classified as “only 

source” or for “research” and for reoccurring services considered as a collective 

bargaining agreement, then Section 31-7-13 Mississippi Code of 1972 annotated must be 

followed. 

 

 Commodities and equipment on mandatory state contract must be ordered 
from the contract source (vendor) unless special approval is granted by the 

state. Commodities and equipment on negotiated state contract should be 

ordered from one of the contract sources (vendors) or the purchase must 

follow Section 31-7-13 in obtaining quotes or bids that do not exceed state 

contract pricing. 

 Purchases of commodities, equipment and certain services that are truly “only 
source” items can only be ordered once the procuring department follows the 

sole source certification process consisting of: checking the “Sole Source” 

box on the requisition in SAP, submitting the online “IT Sole Source Form” or 

the “Non-IT Sole Source Form”, advertising for objections, and receiving 

approval granted by the state. 

 Purchases of single source commodities, equipment and certain services that 
are truly in support of ongoing “research” can only be ordered once the 

procuring department follows the sole source certification process consisting 

of: checking the “Sole Source” box on the requisition in SAP, submitting the 

online “IT Sole Source Form” or the “Non-IT Sole Source Form”, advertising 

for objections, and receiving approval granted by the state. 

 Items and one time services not covered by state contract, but less than $5,000.00 
excluding freight, do not require a special exception form. 

 

Purchase requisitions will be evaluated by Procurement Services as to completeness and 

compliance with state law and university policy regarding the ordering of commodities 

and equipment on state contract, and certain services, as only source items and as 

research only items.
