NOISE 

 

Purpose/Summary: This policy defines the expectations for appropriate noise levels in the 

residence halls and apartments for residents and guests.  

 

At all times an atmosphere that is conducive to sleep and study must be maintained in on-campus 

housing. All visitors are expected to respect both courtesy and quiet hour policies as set forth in 

the Residence Hall Handbook. Courtesy hours are 24 hours a day. Respect for others must be 

maintained at all times. Quiet hours are defined as noise that does not permeate from the student 

room. Quiet hours are in effect from 9:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m., Sunday through Thursday. On 

Friday and Saturday, quiet hours are from 11:00 p.m. until 10:00 a.m. Extended or 24-hour quiet 

hours will begin the Sunday evening of the last week of classes preceding final exams and during 

intersession periods.
