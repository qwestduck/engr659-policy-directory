FERPA-Covered University of Mississippi Records Release for Research 
 
Purpose:  
Obtaining UM student records for research in compliance with FERPA 
 
Background: 
Data from UM student records are commonly requested in human subject research that is reviewed and 
approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) 
(20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. 
This policy provides a standardized, legal procedure for obtaining student records and for retention of 
documented releases for FERPA-protected data. 
 
Authorization for Release of Records: 

• A signed release on paper is required in order for investigators to obtain student records from the 
Registrar. The release must specify exactly what student information is to be released and which 
investigators will have access. Undergraduate investigators cannot have access to identified student 
records. 

• An electronic alternative to a signed release, (e.g., using student emails for identity verification), may be 
allowed in some cases.  The email release must comply with the same requirements as a signed paper 
release. 

 
Records retention: 

• The investigator must retain a copy of the release for 7 years (scanned / electronic copies are 
acceptable). 

 
Requesting Student Data from Registrar – Required Items:  

1. Excel spreadsheet containing student ID numbers and student names – as they appear on their records. 
Columns must be: ID #, Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial or Middle Name. 

2. For each subject, an electronic copy of the release (see model below).  
3. List of specific data requested. 

 
Email all three items to: registrar@olemiss.edu with the Subject Heading “Request for Release of Student 
Records for IRB-Approved Research.” 
 
Electronic alternatives (e.g., a survey sent to a student email address where the student clicks to take the survey 
and then clicks to give consent for listed records) to the below Model Release Authorization will be evaluated 
on a case by case basis. The release, whether signed or electronic, must be included with your IRB application.

INSTRUCTIONS TO RESEARCHER:  

1. Alter only the information specific to your study [italicized and in brackets]  
2. If paper release, append it to the consent form as a separate page (so you can scan it electronically) 
3. If requesting electronic release, include the procedure for gaining identity verification (e.g., from 

valid email addresses) and the release authorization with your IRB application materials.
