Summary/Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to define the procedure for using and reserving 
the Chancellor’s Board Room, 110 Lyceum. 

 
The Chancellor's Board Room is available to anyone for use by University of Mississippi 
Departments and Organizations. 

 
Use of the room is made available by calling the Chancellor's Office (7112) and reserving the

conflict with a reservation (due to the Chancellor’s schedule) might result in the User being 
asked to find another room to use. 

 
A meal or reception can be held in the Board Room. The User will be responsible for making 
sure the table is covered to prevent water or food damage, and they are responsible for all 
cleanup of trash, removal of all food and all containers. The User will be responsible for

The Room may be used after hours and on weekends, but special arrangements need to be made 
prior to the meeting. The User will be responsible for returning the room to its original condition 
upon completion of the meeting. This includes removal of any props or equipment furnished by 
the User, the turning off of all lights and making sure all doors are locked before leaving. 

 
There is no charge for the use of the Board Room, but reservations do have to be made prior to 
the use of the room.
