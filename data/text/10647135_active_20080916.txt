Employment Procedures 
 

Summary/Purpose: The following guidelines relate to the recruitment, employment, and pay 
ranges for University employment.  These guidelines also detail initial requirements for new 
employees to report to Human Resources. 
 
The continual recruitment of competent employees is of primary importance.  In most 
departments, employees are interviewed and recommended directly by the department heads.  In 
the employment of personnel the following procedures are followed: 
 

1. All vacancies are listed electronically through the University’s online employment 
system, jobs.olemiss.edu/hr.  All departments on campus initiate the personnel requisition 
and submit the requisition for approval.  The Employment Office processes the personnel 
requisition and provides the final approval.   An email containing the links for the Hiring 
Manager’s Manual and the Search Committee Manual is sent to the Chair of the search 
committee.  These manuals may also be found at the home page of the online 
employment system, jobs.olemiss.edu/hr.  

 
2. All external hires for our faculty and professional positions will receive a written offer of 

employment.  Depending on type of position, this letter will come from the Chancellor, 
Provost, or Director of Human Resources.  Employees should not begin work until an 
electronic form has been approved by Human Resources. All new employees must report 
to Human Resources on or before their first day of employment.  Promotions and 
reclassifications will be processed by the Department of Human Resources in accordance 
with established procedures. 

 
3. Positions included in grant and contract proposals are not classified at that time of 

submission.  After approval of the grants and contracts, these positions are classified by 
the Department of Human Resources.  The salary rate of the position will be in 
accordance with the classification assigned. 

 
4. It is the policy of The University of Mississippi not to discriminate against any employee 

or applicant for employment on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, sexual 
orientation, national origin, handicap, age, being a disabled veteran or veteran of the 
Vietnam era.  Affirmative action procedures are to be followed in the employment of all 
faculty and staff members.  

 
5. New hire paperwork is completed with the Records Staff no later or on the first day of 

employment.  The Records staff schedules an appointment in advance, however, a “walk-
in” new hire may be accommodated.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service 
authorization of employment form (I-9 form) will be completed by all new employees 
within the provisions of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.  This form 
must
 

 
 

 be completed within 3 days of employment.

Employee Orientation is provided at the time the new hire completes the 
Payroll/Employment information packet.
