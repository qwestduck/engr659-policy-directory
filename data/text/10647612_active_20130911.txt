Policies on Awarding Honorary and Posthumous Degrees 
 

Honorary Degrees:  The University of Mississippi does not officially award honorary 

degrees. 

 

Posthumous Degrees: A degree may be posthumously awarded by the University of 

Mississippi in the following case.  If a student should die during an enrollment period in which he 

or she was enrolled for courses which, if successfully completed, would meet all degree 

requirements, a posthumous degree may be awarded to him or her.  Proposals for posthumous 

degrees should be submitted through the appropriate School or College and must be approved by 

the Council of Academic Administrators and the faculty.
