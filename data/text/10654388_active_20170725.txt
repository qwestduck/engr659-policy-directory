Counseling Center Fees 

Summary/Purpose: to establish the fees assessed for student services at the University 

Counseling Center. 

 Most counseling services are free to eligible students. A fee may be charged for 

special assessment requests. Students will be informed of any and all charges 

before services are provided. 

 Due to heavy demand for services, clients are urgently requested to call (662) 915-

3784 to cancel their appointments at least 1 day (24 hours) in advance. 

 Individual appointments not cancelled at least 2 hours in advance, will be considered 

a no- show and the student will be assessed a late fee of $20.00. Effective July 1, 2017, 

any client not present within 15 minutes of the session start time may be counted as a 

no- show.  These amounts will be charged to the client’s Bursar account.
