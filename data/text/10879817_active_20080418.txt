Summary/Purpose:  Policy delegating to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 
(IACUC) the proposal, development, and approval of policies pertaining to the IACUC. 
 
DEFINITION OF THE DISCRETE CATEGORY OF UNIVERSITY POLICIES 
AFFECTED 
 

 This policy covers only policies bearing on the functions of the Institutional Animal Care 
and Use Committee, which are based on federal law (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 
9 Chapter 1(a) Animal Welfare; Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2131 et. seq.); PHS 
Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals; U.S. Government Principles for 
the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research, and Training; 
Public Law 99-158: “Animals In Research;” Public Law 103-43: “Plan For Use of 
Animals in Research;” and the accrediting body recognized by the PHS Office of 
Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) – the Association for Assessment and 
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC). 

 
INITIATION OF POLICY PROPOSALS, RESPONSIBLE OFFICE, POLICY 
DEVELOPMENT, AND POLICY APPROVAL 
 

 Policies are proposed based on requirements of the federal regulations and the 
interpretation of those regulations to protect animals used in research by authorized 
OLAW and USDA personnel and by AAALAC. 

 Suggestions for new proposals and review for merit come from the IACUC Chair and 
from IACUC members. 

 The IACUC consults with the Vice Chancellor for Research and Sponsored Programs, 
the University Attorneys, and other administrative and academic departments that 
conduct animal research on policy development as deemed necessary by the IACUC. 

 
POLICY APPROVAL 

 Final policy approval requires a majority vote of a quorum meeting of the IACUC. 
 
REGULAR REVIEW OF POLICIES 

 The Responsible Office, the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs Division of 
Research Integrity and Compliance, will schedule policy reviews for usefulness and 
consistency with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, IHL Policies and 
Bylaws, and other University Policies every three years following policy approval or 
more frequently. 

 If the IACUC determines that changes to an IACUC Policy are necessary or prudent as a 
part of the Scheduled Review or at any other time, the IACUC may propose a policy 
change consistent with this Policy.
