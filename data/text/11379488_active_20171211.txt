Accessibility of Technology Services 
 
 

Purpose 

The University of Mississippi (UM) recognizes the importance and value of providing Electronic 
and Information Technology (EIT) services that are accessible to everyone and that can be used 
on a broad spectrum of devices.  The primary reason for adhering to the principles of "universal 
design" is to meet the needs of those who use assistive technology to overcome physical 
disabilities; however, the reality is that well-executed universal design can help everyone. 
Attention to accessibility can result in better, more usable displays when sites are viewed from 
small format devices such as smartphones or mini-computers.   Federal laws require equitable 
use of educational technology, including all programs, services, and communication systems, as 
well as online and digital environments. This policy details the accessibility requirements and 
standards for UM departments as they develop websites, computer labs, and all other EIT 
services. This includes, but is not limited to, learning management systems, audio and video 
files (podcasts and vodcasts), and course software. 

 

 
General Guidelines 

The two most current and widely accepted EIT accessibility standards are: 
 

(1) Section 508: https://www.section508.gov and 

(2) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0:  https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20 
 

Section 508 is federal law requiring that a federal agency’s electronic and information 

technology services be accessible to people with disabilities. Section 508 addresses all kinds of 

technology including software applications, telecommunications products, and personal 

computers, whereas WCAG focuses on the accessibility of websites.  UM and most other 

institutions use Level AA compliance with WCAG 2.0 as an industry standard. 
 

UM departments that deploy EIT services must become familiar with these standards and make 

reasonable efforts to adhere to them. The department head is ultimately responsible for 

ensuring that EIT services deployed by that department are accessible.  This policy applies to 

information technology services hosted locally as well as those offered "in the cloud" and those 

provided or supported by third parties.  Contracts involving EIT services must acknowledge and 

confirm compliance with the accessibility requirements outlined in this policy. 
 

 

When a technology-related service is requested by an individual with a disability, if that service is 

not already accessible in the manner required by the individual making the request, the 

department will promptly offer the service in an alternate, accessible format. The department 

will simultaneously seek a long-term solution to address any future cases.  Extreme

circumstances related to technology compliance should be addressed to the Accessibility 

Compliance Committee consisting of the Chief Information Officer, the Associate Provost 

for Outreach and Continuing Studies, and the Executive Director of Equal Opportunity and 

Regulatory Compliance.  An example of an extreme circumstance might be a non‐

compliant, hosted, online service that is required for accreditation and is offered by single 

vendor. Initial inquiries may be made by emailing  it@olemiss.edu. 
 

Failure to comply may result in restriction of services for a department or other limitations 

as determined by the Accessibility Compliance Committee. Department heads and 

individuals providing electronic technology and information sources are ultimately 

responsible for compliance. Intentional or extremely negligent noncompliance may subject 

individuals to disciplinary action.  See the "Investigation and Disciplinary Action" section of 

the  IT Appropriate Use Policy for the protocol in reporting cases. 
 

The UM Accessibility Statement, https://olemiss.edu/info/access.html, offers points of 

contact for reporting barriers and complaints. 
 

Specific Requirements for Official Web Pages 

Official UM Web Pages must pass all error checks in the Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation 

Tool (  http://wave.webaim.org) in order to be minimally compliant.  Each department 

should additionally ensure the general usability of their web content by adhering to WCAG 

2.0 Level AA when creating new content.  The Official Web Page Policy defines an "Official 

Web Page" to be "a Web page presented on behalf of UM, sanctioned by the appropriate 

UM unit." That policy also requires an "Accessibility" link to 

https://olemiss.edu/info/access.html on the primary home page for each UM unit. 
 

 

Some websites are not conducive to evaluation by WAVE. Examples are websites that 

require a username and password or are highly interactive. These may be evaluated using 

other means but must meet the standards included in the WebAIM Section 508 checklist: 

http://webaim.org/standards/508/checklist. In extreme circumstances, where compliance 

is not technically possible or requires extraordinary measures due to the nature or the intent 

of the website, exceptions may be approved on a case by case basis by The Accessibility 

Compliance Committee. Failure to comply will result in having the page disabled from 

public viewing.
