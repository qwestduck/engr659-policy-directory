The University of Mississippi 

Leave Without Pay 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Employees may be granted leave of absence without pay for either short 
periods or extended periods of time.  Factors of consideration used to approve a leave and 
information regarding reinstatement of an employee when the leave expires are given. 
 
 
Leave of absence without pay may be granted by the appropriate division head (Chancellor, 
Provost or Vice Chancellor) upon the recommendation of an employee's department head. A 
leave may be for a short period of time (not to exceed 30 days) to attend to personal business or 
may be for an extended period of time of up to one year. For extended leave, more serious 
consideration will be given to such factors as the nature of the leave, the length of service of the 
employee, and whether a grant of the request would, in the University's opinion, best serve its 
interest. Leave of absence for one year or less shall be permitted without forfeiting previously 
accumulated continuous service.  
 
An employee granted leave without pay will be reinstated to the same or a similar position at the 
expiration of the leave if the employee is able to perform the duties required by the position and 
the same or a similar position still exists at the University.
