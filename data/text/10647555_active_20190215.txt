HOUSING WEAPONS POLICY 
 
Summary/Purpose: The possession of weapons in any University of Mississippi residence hall 
or student housing is prohibited.  

 
The possession of weapons is prohibited within residence halls or student housing at all times, 
regardless of whether one has in their possession a valid, unexpired state enhanced concealed carry 
firearms permit or the equivalent permit issued by a state with a reciprocity agreement with 
Mississippi. For the purposes of this policy, a weapon is any dangerous instrument used, attempted 
or threatened to be used, or is readily capable of being used to cause death or serious physical 
injury, including but not limited to the following: any gun, shotgun, rifle, pistol or other firearm, 
any device from which a shot, projectile, or other object may be discharged by force (whether 
operable or inoperable, loaded or unloaded), nooses, sticks, poles, pipes, “nun-chucks,” 
blackjacks, leaded canes, brass or metallic knuckles, bowie knives, dirk knives, butcher knives, 
switchblade knives, daggers, blades, machetes, swords, hatchets, metal spikes, bow and arrows, 
slingshots, metal darts, razors and razor blades (except as used for personal grooming), “BB guns,” 
“air rifles,” “air pistols,” pellet guns, paint ball guns, laser pointers, fire, dynamite, dynamite 
cartridges, bombs, grenades, torches, gun powder, firecrackers, fireworks, mines or powerful 
explosives, and any other pyrotechnic, incendiary or explosive devices. 
 
To ensure the safety of all persons on its campus, to protect University property and to ensure no 
disruption of its educational mission, the University also prohibits the wearing of masks, disguises 
and other means of concealing one’s identity. The wearing of protective gear, such as body armor, 
shields and chainmail, is likewise prohibited. 
 
Violation of this policy will subject one to disciplinary action, which may include termination, 
sanctions under the University conduct system, immediate removal from the residence halls or 
student housing and loss of all housing privileges. Students removed from the residence halls or 
student housing for disciplinary reasons will be responsible for the entire rental cost of the housing 
agreement period, both fall and spring semesters. Possession of a weapon in violation of this policy 
may also subject one to criminal liability and removal from campus, campus events or facilities.
