SMOKING 

 

Purpose/Summary: This policy describes Student Housing's expectations regarding 

smoking and tobacco use. Smoking or tobacco use is not permitted inside any on-campus 

residence under any circumstances.  

 

Smoking is prohibited at all times, and at all locations of the University of Mississippi Oxford 

campus, including University-owned facilities, properties, and grounds. As a result, all residence 

halls and apartments, including the areas around entryways, are smoke-free. This means that 

smoking is not permitted in buildings at any time. Evidence of smoking in a student room is 

sufficient for a student to be held accountable for violating this policy.  

 

Students found in violation of this policy will be fined $25 for each violation, and disciplinary 

action will be taken. For complete information about policy enforcement, go to
