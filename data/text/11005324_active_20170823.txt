Eligibility for Services 
 

 

Summary/Purpose:  To define eligibility for services offered by the Career Center. 

 

The following individuals are eligible for services offered by the Career Center: 

 

1. All currently enrolled students (undergraduate and graduate) seeking career planning, 
major exploration, and employment information.  Services are available up to one year 

after graduation.   

2. University faculty and staff, as career center staff schedules allow. 
3. Alumni who pay a $50 Career Center alumni fee (includes three 1-hour career advising 

sessions in person or by phone).  The initial consultation is complimentary, after which 

the fee for services will begin.  Career assessments require an additional fee, which also 

includes the interpretation session that follows. 

 

Note:  All University alumni are eligible for registration on Handshake software, walk-in 

services, and participation in any Career Center event. University alumni who are active 

members of the Alumni Association are eligible to schedule up to three appointments 

with a Career Center staff member for a reduced fee of $15.00 per session or $30.00 for 

three 1-hour sessions. 

 

4. Other individuals as determined by the Assistant Directors, Associate Director, or 
Director regarding eligibility for Career Center services. 

 

Please note:  Currently enrolled students are given first priority for scheduling individual 

career advising appointments.
