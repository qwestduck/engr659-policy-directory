The University of Mississippi 
 

Role of the Faculty in the Administration of Academic Affairs 
 

The University of Mississippi adheres to the principles of shared university governance 
enunciated in the "Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities" jointly formulated in 
1966 by the American Association of University Professors, the American Council on 
Education, and the American Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges. In 
accordance with that document, the University of Mississippi recognizes that: "the faculty has 
primary responsibility for such fundamental areas as curriculum, subject matter and methods of 
instruction, research, faculty status, and those aspects of student life which relate to the 
educational process." The University therefore endorses a process of consultation to assure that 
academic decisions are made through a joint effort of the faculty and administrators and with the 
cooperation and support of a majority of the faculty constituency affected. 

 
The University recognizes that the faculty has special concern and responsibility for the 
establishment of the University's general education policies and goals and particularly for their 
implementation regarding curriculum, instruction, research, faculty status, and degree 
requirements.  In addition, the University recognizes the faculty's necessary participation in 
shared governance regarding long-range plans for the institution, the allocation and use of 
physical resources, budgets, compensation, and the selection of academic officers. 

 
The University acknowledges that true faculty participation in the governance of academic 
affairs requires good faith on the part of both the faculty and administration and genuine 
commitment by both to a program of shared governance.
