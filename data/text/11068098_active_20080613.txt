INDEPENDENT STUDY PROCTORED TESTING POLICY 
 
 
1. Independent study students must comply with the Independent Study Proctored 

Testing Policy.  

2. A student who wishes to receive credit for an independent study course must take all 
proctored examinations (hereinafter “examinations”) under the supervision of an 
approved test site official (hereinafter “proctor”). 

3. It is the primary responsibility of the individual taking the course (hereinafter 
“student”) to locate a proctor, as required, and to communicate this information 
accurately to the Department of Online Learning and Independent Study using the 
appropriate examination form.  

4. Students must submit the appropriate examination form for each examination 
required and for each course that requires an examination. 

5. Students should submit the appropriate examination form at least ten (10) working 
days prior to their examination appointment.  Failure to submit the form at the 
appropriate time may result in the student being unable to take the test with that 
proctor at his/her scheduled time.  The Department of Online Learning and 
Independent Study is unable to accommodate proctor requests within seventy-two 
(72) hours or less of the scheduled examination date and time.   

6. All students must use a proctor approved by the Department of Online Learning and 
Independent Study. 

7. The Department of Online Learning and Independent Study reserves the right to 
reject any proctor and to require the student to come to a campus of The University of 
Mississippi to take the examination. 

8. It is the responsibility of the student to pay the proctor fees required by some testing 
centers. 

9. If an exam must be sent via express mail to meet a testing deadline as a result of a 
student’s delay in submitting the appropriate examination form or of inaccuracies on 
the form, the express mail charges will be charged to the student’s Bursar account.
