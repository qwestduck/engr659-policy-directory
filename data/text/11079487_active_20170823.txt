Simultaneous University, Local, State, or Federal Actions
 
DSA.SC.300.035
 

Summary/Purpose: To make students aware of university conduct processes during 
simultaneous actions by federal, state, and/or local authorities or courts. 

The University of Mississippi’s conduct system is designed to promote the University’s 
educational mission. The process is separate and distinct from any federal, state, or local criminal 
or civil court system. To ensure that the educational potential of the process is preserved, the 
university should provide a prompt response to behavior that is inconsistent with university 
policies. University conduct proceedings will not be delayed until off-campus proceedings are 
concluded. 

If a violation of university policy also subjects a student or organization to criminal or civil 
liability, the university conduct system will determine whether university policy has been 
violated on the basis of preponderance of the evidence (whether it is more likely than not that a 
violation occurred). Criminal or civil proceedings may use a different or higher standard of 
evidence. 

The University conduct system may accept a criminal conviction or plea by any trial court of 
competent jurisdiction as a final factual determination that the student has violated applicable 
University policy. 

The university conduct process does not affect the jurisdiction of the courts and other civil 
authorities over any University of Mississippi student. Membership in the university community 
does not create any privilege or immunity from the laws and other regulations that apply equally 
to all residents of the state of Mississippi.
