The University of Mississippi

ADMISSION OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES

The University of Mississippi complies with all applicable laws regarding affirmative action and
equal opportunity in all its activities and programs and does not discriminate against anyone
protected by law because of disability.  Decisions regarding admission to the University are
made on the basis of admissions standards stated above.  If assistance is needed to complete
the admissions process because of disability-related reasons, incoming students must inform
admissions’ personnel of those needs.

In order for students to receive academic accommodations at The University of Mississippi, their
eligibility must be verified.  Students must be fully admitted to the University before the
verification process can begin.  For information regarding the verification process and
documentation guidelines, students who may require academic accommodations should contact
the Office of Student Disability Services at (662) 915-7128. Information can also be accessed
through the office’s Web site at www.olemiss.edu/depts/sds.

The University of Mississippi will make a good-faith effort to provide reasonable academic
accommodations to those students who request assistance and who are verified as eligible.
Students who may require accommodations or services through the Office of Student Disability
Services are encouraged to ascertain, before enrolling in the University, whether the specific
accommodations or services they may require would be available to them.
