The University of Mississippi

ACADEMIC RESTART POLICY

A former University of Mississippi student who has been out of any educational institution for the
48 consecutive months immediately prior to the time the student wishes to begin academic restart,
may start his or her college education completely over by invoking the University’s academic
restart policy. The student will be considered as a totally new student from the time of first
enrollment after the 48-month hiatus, and all academic regulations for new students (e.g.,
concerning probation, suspension, and honors) will apply. The new enrollment need not have been
at The University of Mississippi.

A student’s grades obtained prior to academic restart will remain on the student’s transcript.
However, no grade made prior to academic restart will be included in the student’s cumulative
grade-point average, and no credits earned prior to academic restart will fulfill graduation
requirements.

A student’s eligibility for academic restart at The University of Mississippi is determined
regardless of the student’s restart status at other institutions.  A student may use The University
of Mississippi’s academic restart policy only one time.
