Absences from Work 

Summary/Purpose:  Regulations for reporting absences from work are given. 

A University employee who finds it necessary to be absent from duty as the result of sickness or 
for other sufficient reason is expected to call the office head or person under whom he/she is 
employed as soon as possible. If an employee has reason to believe he/she will be absent, he/she 
is expected to notify his/her supervisor in advance. A record of absences is entered into SAP and 
maintained in the office where the individual is employed. See "Leave Policies."

Regular attendance is considered an essential function of each University job. The University 
reserves the right to take appropriate action to address excessive absenteeism.
