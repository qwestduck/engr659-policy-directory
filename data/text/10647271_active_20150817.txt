Health and Safety Inspections 
 

Summary/Purpose:   This policy explains the scheduling and procedures for health and safety 
inspections in residential facilities. 
 
The Department of Student Housing staff conduct health and safety inspections once per 
semester. Students will receive 72-hour notice of upcoming inspections. Health and safety 
inspections will be scheduled once during the fall, spring, and summer semesters. Additional 
health and safety inspections may be scheduled at any point throughout the academic year.  

It is critical that a reasonable level of cleanliness be maintained in residential areas. If it is 
determined that a room or apartment within a residential facility poses a safety hazard, 
residents have not adequately disposed of trash, and/or an unhealthy living environment has 
been created, residents will have 48 hours upon receipt of notice to clean the room/apartment 
and/or correct the hazard(s). Student housing staff will conduct a second inspection of the 
room or apartment within 3-5 business days of the initial inspection. Should the residential 
space remain unacceptable after the second inspection, student housing personnel will 
clean/repair/replace the noted items and the resident(s) will be charged fees based on cleaning 
or repairs required.
