Terminations

Summary/Purpose:  Information is given to department heads, chairs, and supervisors 
regarding their responsibility for proper completion of required paperwork.  This will ensure that 
no overpayments occur for terminated employees. 

It is the responsibility of the department chair or head to initiate papers for terminating 
employment of those members leaving the department; otherwise, persons leaving the University 
may receive salary checks after employment is terminated. In the event recovery of overpayment 
involves expenditures of funds or is impossible to accomplish, the department/unit chair or head 
is financially liable for such overpayment. Terminations of all employees are submitted on HR 
Form 3.
