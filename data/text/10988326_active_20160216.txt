Classroom Use of Live or Preserved Vertebrate Animals 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Requirements for using vertebrate animals in teaching. 

All classroom use of live vertebrate animals requires IACUC approval.  In many cases, the 
IACUC requires teaching protocols to be submitted and approved. For continued use, these 
protocols must be renewed every three years. As part of the annual update process, the IACUC 
requires teaching faculty to document whether alternatives such as computer simulations, videos, 
reusable dissection dummies, etc. have been identified during the past year.  Instructors who are 
planning to use animals in their classrooms should factor in at least 4-6 weeks lead time between 
submitting a protocol and the date they need to have the animals on hand.  

See related policy:  Acquisition of Animals from Unapproved Suppliers, RSP.RI.302.015. 

For use of preserved vertebrate animals, see form:  Permission for Classroom Use of Preserved 
Animals
