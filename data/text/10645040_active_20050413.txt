Uncollectible Costs on Sponsored Projects 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Costs charged to sponsored projects that cannot be collected from the 
sponsor for reasons such as unallowability, unallocability, dispute with or bankruptcy by the 
sponsor, or other reasons, must be paid for with principal investigator or departmental funds. If 
the uncollectible costs (or portion thereof) are subsequently collected from the sponsor 
(bankruptcy settlement, legal settlement, repayment plan, etc.), the collected amount will be 
refunded to the department or principal investigator.
