Job Location and Development (JLD) Services 

 

 

Summary/Purpose:  To provide information on how currently enrolled students can 

apply for part-time, off-campus jobs through the Career Center. 

 

 

The Job Location and Development (JLD) service helps currently enrolled students 

obtain part-time employment in Oxford and surrounding areas.  Job listings are posted 

outside the Career Center entrance and on the Career Center website 

(http://career.olemiss.edu). 

 

 Students who are interested in obtaining a referral for a job listing are required to: 

 

1. Complete a JLD student registration card in the Career Center 
2. List the job numbers for the positions of interest and inquire within the Career 

Center, in person, during the designated office hours posted at the Career 

Center’s main entrance or on the web site.  

 

After the registration and inquiry processes are completed, the student will receive a 

detailed description of the position and a referral to the business to complete the 

application process. 

 

It is the student’s responsibility to report to the Career Center if he or she has been hired 

through the referral process.  If hired for the position, students will complete and return 

the Student Job Placement Information form to the Career Center.  Failure to report hire 

status will result in suspension of services for a period of up to one academic semester.
