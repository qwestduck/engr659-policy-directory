renewable each calendar year. 

 The first session is free with a nominal fee of $30.00 per visit for the remaining 3 sessions. This 

fee will be processed as a payroll deduction. 

 Employee concerns that require more than four (4) sessions or that fall outside the scope of the 

EAP-MH will be provided suitable referral contact information. 

 Employees may be absent from work during the workday, with the permission of their 

department head, for one consultation session of up to one hour per week. 

 Individual appointments not cancelled at least 2 hours in advance, will be considered a no-show.  

Effective July 1, 2017, any client not present within 15 minutes of the session start time may be 

counted as a no-show.  These amounts will be payroll deducted.
