 Student Loan Code of Conduct Overview 

     

The Office of Financial Aid (OFA) at The University of Mississippi is dedicated to the highest levels 

of ethical behavior. Employees within the OFA will avoid any conflict of interest or the perception 

thereof.  

Additionally, in compliance with the Student Loan Code of Conduct requirements outlined in 

the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008, The University of Mississippi OFA prohibits all of 

the following: 

• Revenue sharing agreements with lenders 

• Conflicts of interest 

• Accepting gifts above a nominal value from lenders 

• Contracting arrangements with a lender that provides compensation to school staff 

• Assigning a lender to a borrower or refusing to certify a loan for a borrower’s choice of lender 

• Accepting from lenders any staffing assistance for call center or financial aid office 

• Accepting compensation for service on an advisory board, except that reasonable expenses 

associated with that service may be reimbursed by the lender 

• Accepting compensation for any type of consulting agreement or contract to provide services to 

or on behalf of a lender relating to education loans 

• Steering borrowers to particular lenders or delaying loan certifications 

• Offers of funds for private loans to students in exchange for providing concessions or promises 

to the lender for a specific number of FSA loans, a specified loan volume, or a preferred lender 

arrangement 

For the following purposes, it is not considered a “gift” to the school for a lender to provide: 

• Standard materials, activities or programs on issues related to a loan, default aversion, default 

prevention or financial literacy (i.e. brochures, workshops, training) 



• Food, refreshments, training or informational material that is designed to improve the service of 

a lender or servicer if the training contributes to the professional development of the school 

staff 

• Favorable terms, conditions and borrower benefits, as long as these are provided to all students 

at the school 

• Entrance and exit counseling services, as long as the school controls the counseling and does 

not promote the products and services of the lender 

• Philanthropic contributions not tied to loan volume
