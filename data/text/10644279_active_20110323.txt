External Reviews or Audits on Sponsored Projects 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Primary responsibility for the fiscal administration of a grant or contract 
lies with the Principal Investigator.  If a request or visit is made by a sponsoring agency for any 
type of review or audit (program review, desk audit, etc.), the agency representative must be 
directed to the Accounting Office for coordination of the work. 

Any audit report sent directly by a sponsoring agency to the Principal Investigator or to his/her 
department must be sent to the Accounting Office for coordination of a response. Any 
unresolved audit disallowance will be the responsibility of the Principal Investigator and his/her 
department.
