Acquisition of Animals from Unapproved Suppliers 

 

Summary/Purpose:  Research animals must be sourced through an IACUC-approved supplier.   

 

 

Typically, the following sources will not be approved without compelling scientific justification. 

Such suppliers might include, but are not limited to: 

 

1. Pet stores 
2. Independent breeders 
3. Animal hospitals and clinics 
4. Farmers and ranchers 
5. Local veterinarians 
6. Individuals 

 

Only the IACUC may approve animal suppliers that fit the above or other categories on a case-

by-case basis.
