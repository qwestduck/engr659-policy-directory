Cooking 

Summary/Purpose:  The purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines for cooking in the 
kitchens within residential facilities. 

Residents are required to act responsibly in the preparation of meals so as to not create fire 
safety issues or hazardous conditions. 

• Food that is cooking is NOT to be left unattended.  Pots and pans, especially those
containing grease and oils, are to be removed from heat sources immediately after
cooking.

• Heat sources (burners and oven) are to be turned off when not in use.
• Residents may not use wok pans on the stove burners. Residents may use

freestanding electric woks (placed on the countertop) instead.
• Charcoal grills are only permitted for use as long as they are used at a minimum

distance of 25 feet away from all buildings and are closely monitored at all times.
• Residents may not use charcoal grills in breezeways or on balconies. The use of gas

grills is strictly prohibited.
• Cooking/frying oils and grease are to be placed in appropriate containers to cool and

properly disposed of in dumpsters.  Containers with oils/grease may NOT be placed
outside of the apartments to cool. Appropriate containers for disposal include:
plastic or aluminum containers with sealable lid (i.e. coffee cans, margarine
containers, etc.)
