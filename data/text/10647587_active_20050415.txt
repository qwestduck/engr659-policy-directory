Contractual Services

Summary/Purpose:  This guideline is for non-University employed personnel who perform 
clerical duties under a contract agreement. 

When a clerical-related job is to be performed by other than University-employed personnel, the 
contract agreement must be approved in advance by the Director of Human Resources to ensure 
that a realistic and applicable rate is being paid for the contracted work.
