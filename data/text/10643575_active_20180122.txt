Meal Plans Purchased in the Fall 

Summary/Purpose:  Notifies patrons that meal plans are renewed 

automatically for every spring term based on meal plan selected in fall semester 

 

All freshmen assessed for housing are required to purchase a semester meal plan 

BOTH Fall and Spring semesters of their freshman year, regardless of Greek 

affiliation.  If a meal plan is not selected, the minimum required meal plan will be 

automatically assessed. The RC Unlimited Plus One meal plan is required for all 

residents of the Residential College, regardless of classification. 

 

ALL members holding a semester meal plan in the fall semester will be 

automatically assessed for the same meal plan in the spring semester, regardless of 

Greek affiliation or classification, unless a refund request or meal plan change 

request is submitted in writing to the ID Center, and approved to cancel.  

 

 

Freshmen who are a part of a group or activity such as a fraternity or sorority that 

requires participation in a separate meal program may purchase a Greek meal plan, 

offered in the spring semester only. 

 

Changes must be submitted to the ID Center in writing or by meal plan change 

request form at olemissdining.com, before the change deadline to be considered.  

No late requests will be considered or exceptions made.
