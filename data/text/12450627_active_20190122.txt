Policy 

A. Firewall rule change log review and documentation  

1. UM manages firewalls to protect information contained in HIPAA covered entity networks. 
These firewalls are configured to restrict IP traffic through both ingress and egress rules to 
only permit access to sites necessary to perform the necessary operational functions 
required and permit updating and patching of systems. 

2. A firewall rule change log document is operationally maintained for each covered entity 
that records the date and time of rule adds, changes and deletions. 

3. Annually, when the policy renewal processes, the change log document is reviewed for an 
overview of the previous year’s changes.
