Just In Time Submissions 
 

Summary/Purpose: To define and establish the principles of “Just-in-Time” research proposal 
submissions. 
 
Definition: 
The Division of Research Integrity and Compliance uses the “just-in-time” (JIT) process for 
submission of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approval of a federally 
funded research proposal. Using this process, the University may defer IACUC approval until it 
is determined that the proposal will likely qualify for an award. To avoid delays in activating 
awards, it is the PI’s responsibility to submit the Animal Study Application to the IACUC 
as soon as they receive a score that may be within the fundable range. This will ensure an 
adequate amount of time for the PI to make any revisions to the protocol application and 
for the IACUC to conduct the review. All investigators should review the NIH guidelines 
described at 
http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-064.html and listed below. 
 
NIH Principles And Expectations (Applies to all funding sources) 
The NIH has emphasized certain principles and expectations of the “just-in-time” process for 
IACUC review and approval. 
 
• The fundamental PHS Policy requirement that no award may be made without an approved 
Assurance and without verification of IACUC approval remains in effect. This change only 
affects the timing of the submission of the verification of that review. 
 
• This change is intended to permit flexibility and discretion on the part of the institution. It is 
not a requirement that IACUC approval be deferred. Institutional officials retain the discretion to 
require IACUC approval prior to peer review in certain circumstances of their choosing if they 
so desire. 
 
• Under no circumstances may an IACUC be pressured to approve a protocol, or be overruled on 
its decision to withhold approval. NIH peer review groups will continue to address the adequacy 
of animal usage and protections in their review of an application, and will continue to raise 
concerns about animal welfare issues. However, in no way is peer review intended to supersede 
or serve as a replacement for IACUC approval. An institution that elects to use IACUC “just-in-
time” bears the responsibility for supporting the role of the IACUC. 
 
• It remains incumbent upon investigators to be totally forthcoming and timely in conveying to 
their IACUCs any modifications related to project scope and animal usage that may result from 
the NIH review and award process. Should an institution find that one of its investigators 
disregards his/her responsibilities, the institution may, for example, determine that all animal 
protocols from that investigator be subject to IACUC approval before it will permit submission 
of an application from that investigator.

• The existing PHS Policy requirement that modifications required by the IACUC be submitted 
to the NIH with the verification of IACUC approval remains in effect, and it remains the 
responsibility of institutions to communicate any IACUC-imposed changes to NIH staff. 
 
• The NIH understands its responsibility to ensure that institutions are given adequate notice to 
allow for timely IACUC review prior to award, and will take appropriate internal measures to 
fulfill its responsibility to establish timely feedback.
