BID REQUIREMENTS – DOLLAR AMOUNTS  

 
 

Summary/Purpose:  To establish dollar threshold amounts for purchase orders covering 

commodities, equipment and certain services.  

 

 

When submitting Purchase Requisitions for the ordering of commodities and equipment not 

covered under an approved state contract, agency contract, or approved special exception, and 

for reoccurring services considered as a collective bargaining agreement, then Section 31-7-13 

Mississippi Code of 1972 annotated must be followed.  

 

 Purchases of $5000.00 OR less require only one price quote, either verbal or in writing.  

 Purchases between $5,000.01 and $50,000.00 must have two (2) independent written 
price quotes from two independent sources on file prior to the order being issued.  

 Purchases $50,000.01 and above require advertising once each week for two consecutive 
weeks and for sealed bids to be received and publicly opened at an established time and 

place, no earlier than eight (8) working days after the last date of publication. 

 The bid opening for construction projects with total cost in excess of $50,000 must not be 
sooner than sixteen (16) working days after the last date of publication 

 

Purchase requisitions will be evaluated by Procurement Services as to completeness and 

compliance with state law and university policy regarding the ordering of commodities, 

equipment and collective bargaining agreements for certain services including some “labor only” 

arrangements / contracts.
