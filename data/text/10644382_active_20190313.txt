Refund Checks 
 

Summary/Purpose:  The University of Mississippi Bursar’s policy on issuing payment for 
refund of credit balances.   
 
 
Refund checks issued by the Office of the Bursar will either be direct deposited into a bank 
account of your choice or mailed to the individual’s billing address or the standard address if 
there is no billing address identified.  Refunds created from Parent Plus loans go directly to the 
parent.  Refund checks cannot be picked up in person. 
 
The University highly encourages students to use direct deposit.  Some of the advantages of 
direct deposit are: normally deposited to your bank account within the next 2 business days, 
mailing address problems are eliminated, and protection against theft or the loss of checks.   
Financial Aid refunds issued by direct deposit are processed on a daily basis; however, financial 
aid refunds issued by check are processed only one time per week.  Upon request, refunds of 
credit balances, other than financial aid, will be processed bi-weekly.  Replacement checks will 
not be issued until 15 days after the date the original check was issued. 
Please refer to the Office of the Bursar website at:  https://bursar.olemiss.edu for Direct Deposit 
Information.  You may sign up for direct deposit online through myOleMiss using your webID.  
Once logged on, you should choose Financials, then Update Bank Account Information and 
follow the steps.
