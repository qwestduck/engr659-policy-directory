Quadrennial Review of University Administrators 

 
All administrators, including department/unit chairs, directors with 50% or greater of their time 

devoted to administration, academic deans, associate or assistant deans, vice chancellors, associate 

and assistant vice chancellors, including the Provost/Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, and 

any other administrator at a similar level shall  be reviewed after they have served four full years 

in office and every fourth year thereafter.  No later than two weeks before the review deadline, 

administrators are asked to submit a summary of accomplishments and challenges as related to 

the goals and mission of their unit. The document should be composed with the goal of providing 

information to faculty and staff who have been asked to comment on the administratorâ€™s 

reappointment. The document should be placed on a password protected website for exclusive 

review by faculty, staff, and others who have been asked to provide input. The purpose and 

procedures for the review will be determined by each Division of the University, the review will 

be conducted by the immediate superior administrator, and details of the procedure are available in 

the office of the Chancellor or the respective Vice Chancellor. The procedure must always include 

a means of input from employees who report to the administrator being reviewed. An annual 

review by a superior administrator does not substitute for a quadrennial review, and quadrennial 

reviews should not take the place of annual performance evaluations.  The Office of Human 

Resources will maintain a schedule of quadrennial reviews and will inform each administrator 

and his/her superior when the former should be reviewed.
