Classification Plan (VCP) 
 

Summary/Purpose:  The components from which the majority of staff positionsâ€™ compensation 
is determined along with the objective results of creating an equitable and uniform compensation 
system is given. 
 
 
The Variable Compensation Plan maintained for the majority of staff positions at the University 
is reflective of the duties, responsibilities, work requirements, minimum qualifications, and 
essential functions of the positions. The Plan is designed to establish and maintain a 
compensation system which is equitable and uniform, and which will enable the University to 
attract and retain a high level of qualified employees. For further information, see the Policy and 
Implementation Manual, The Variable Compensation Plan (VCP), which can be found on the
