Flex Refunds 

Summary/Purpose:  Required Flex specifics including carry forward and refund information  

Any remaining balance on a Flex account is carried forward each semester. Carryover balances may not be used to meet 
future required deposits. Flex amounts deposited as part of the requirement are not transferable or refundable except in 
cases of official withdrawal from the university or upon graduation. All other refund requests will be honored only after 
proof of enrollment at another institution is provided, or if the student is not enrolled after the close of enrollment for the 
next academic semester. Any approved refunds are processed with a $20 drop fee and the remaining balance is forwarded 
to the last known home address after any Bursar account balances are satisfied.
