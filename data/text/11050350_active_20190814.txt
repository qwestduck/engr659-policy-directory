Mandatory Training Components for Research Animal Surgery   

  
Summary/Purpose:  Requirements for performing surgery on laboratory animals.  

  

Policy  

USDA Regulations (9 CFR 2.32) require that individuals performing surgery on animals be 

appropriately qualified and trained. PHS Policy (IV.C.1.f.) requires that personnel conducting 

procedures on the species being maintained or studied will be appropriately qualified and trained 

in those procedures. All investigators and staff who perform or participate in surgery on 

laboratory animals in any teaching, testing, or research protocol at The University of Mississippi 

must complete mandatory training.   

  

Procedure  

All research personnel must receive training, demonstrate proficiency, and be certified by the 

Attending Veterinarian (AV) before performing surgery unsupervised.  Training components 

include:  

  

 1. Complete required AALAS training  
  

 2. Observe and assist AV (or experienced, qualified personnel) perform surgery  
  

 3. Perform surgery, including pre-operative procedure, under direct supervision of AV until 
competent   

  

 4. Demonstrate thorough post-operative observational skills to the AV.
