Summary/Purpose:  The guidelines regarding who is responsible for informing workers about 
leave information is given.  How leave time is accrued for new employees and those who have

It shall be the responsibility of the department head to inform those working under them of 
policies on Personal (vacation) and Major Medical (sick) Leave, to submit proper leave records 
to SAP, and to administer the policies in accordance with the provisions stated below. An 
employee who has been terminated and later is reemployed by the University will begin a new 
period of employment for leave purposes. Employees who begin work from the first to and 
including the 15th of the month will receive credit for a full month; those who begin work on the 
16th or later earn credit beginning on the first of the next month. Employees are not allowed to 
carry a deficit balance for Personal (vacation) Leave or Major Medical (sick) Leave.  Leave 
accruals will not be added to employees' balances until the last working day of the month.  This 
time will be available for use beginning the first day of the next month.  Employees terminating 
from the University must work through the last working day of the month in order to accrue 
leave.
