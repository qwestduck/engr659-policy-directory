UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI 
 

Right to Relocate 
 

Summary/Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to explain the right of student housing to 
relocate residents including those with reserved room assignments who reside off campus. 
 
The university, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to relocate residents to other spaces 
when in the residents’ best interests and/or those of fellow residents and/or those of the 
Department of Student Housing and the University of Mississippi. When it is determined that a 
resident is not residing in an assigned space for 50% or more of the contracted time, the 
university reserves the right to relocate the resident.  
 
Upon relocation: 

• Resident will be notified in writing of his/her obligation to the housing contract. 
• Resident will be notified in writing of the relocation and advised of the new reserved 

space. 
• Resident will be required to check out and to return key, if applicable, within 24 hours. If 

the resident fails to return a key, a lock change will be ordered. The student will be 
assessed a lock change fee, which will be billed to the bursar account. Once the lock 
change has occurred, the fee will not be reversed.
