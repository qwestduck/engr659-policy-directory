Hazing
 
DSA.SC.200.035
 

Summary/Purpose: To educate University students concerning hazing and to protect the 
University community from hazing and its effects. 

Students and student organizations at the University of Mississippi will exercise integrity 
and respect for the dignity of each person by refraining from the act of hazing in any 
form. According to hazingprevention.org, hazing is any action taken or situation created, 
regardless of the person’s willingness to participate, that causes embarrassment, 
harassment, ridicule, or risks emotional and/or physical harm to members of a group or 
team 

Examples include, but are not limited to, the following: 
•	 Requiring new members/rookies to perform duties not assigned to other members 
•	 Socially isolating new members/rookies 
•	 Line-ups and drills/tests on meaningless information 
•	 Expecting certain items to always be in one’s possession 
•	 Asking new members to wear embarrassing or humiliating attire 
•	 Expecting new members/rookies to perform personal service to other members such as 

carrying books, errands, cooking, cleaning etc. 
•	 Sleep deprivation 
•	 Forced or coerced alcohol or other drug consumption 
•	 Forced or coerced ingestion of vile substances or concoctions 
•	 Expecting illegal activity 

In addition to sanctions from the University conduct system, students and organizations who 
participate in or condone hazing may subject themselves to criminal prosecution and/or civil 
liability.
