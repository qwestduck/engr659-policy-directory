Participant Support Costs 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Define participant support costs and describe how such are accounted for 
by the University 

Section 200.75 of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance at 2 CFR 200 
Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal 
Awards defines participant support as direct costs paid to or on behalf of participants or trainees, 
but not employees, in connection with conferences or training projects.   

Examples of participant support costs for participants or trainees include: 

 Stipends 
 Subsistence allowances 
 Travel allowances 
 Registration fees 

Participant support costs are accounted for in separately identified sponsored program accounts 
established by the Office of Accounting.  Participant support costs are coded to standard general 
ledger accounts based on the nature of the expense. 

Principal investigators are required to identify and properly charge expenses to the participant 
support account in accordance with the terms and conditions of each agreement as well in 
conformity with the provisions of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance at 2 
CFR 200 Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for 
Federal Awards, as applicable.
