Summary/Purpose: To give notice about students’ responsibility to refrain from harassment or 
any other unreasonable interference with another. 
 
Students and other members of the University community have the right to an environment free 
of conduct that unreasonably interferes, hinders, or otherwise denies another a suitable working, 
living, or learning environment. Therefore, members of the University community should refrain 
from harassing others or creating an environment that denies others a suitable working, living, or 
educational environment. 
 
For conduct to violate this policy, the conduct must be more than merely offensive; it must be so 
objectively offensive, pervasive, and/or severe that if repeated it would effectively deny the 
victim access to the University’s resources and opportunities, unreasonably interfere with the 
victim’s work or living environment, or deprive the victim of some other protected right. 
Examples of conduct prohibited by this policy include, but are not limited to, the following: 
intentionally inflicting severe emotional distress or harm; fighting words (words that actually 
tend to provoke immediate violent reaction); obscene, lewd, or lascivious conduct; defaming 
another (a false statement that harms the reputation of another); and speech or conduct based 
upon race, color, gender, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, religion, national 
origin, age, disability, veteran status, or genetic information that is so objectively offensive to 
effectively deny the victim access to the resources and opportunities of the University. 
 
This policy shall not be construed to impair any constitutionally protected activity, including 
speech, protest, or assembly. 
 
In addition to the University conduct process, the University of Mississippi provides a 
mechanism to address grievances that may arise over sexual harassment (including sexual assault 
and relationship violence) or alleged unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, gender, 
sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, religion, national origin, age, disability, 
veteran status, or genetic information as prohibited by Title VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964, Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, and Sections 503 and 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Incidents of harassment should be reported to the Office of Conflict 
Resolution and Student Conduct.   Complaints related to sexual harassment (including sexual 
assault or relationship violence) should be submitted to the Title IX Coordinator (see University 
Sexual Harassment Policy ACA.EO.100.010).
