Cost Sharing on Sponsored Projects Allowed Only When Required  
or Encouraged by Sponsor 

 
Summary/Purpose:  To define the circumstances under which cost sharing will be allowed in 
sponsored project proposal budgets; includes instructions for documentation of cost sharing in 
the proposal and throughout the project. 
 
 
Cost sharing (also called matching) should be included in the budget accompanying a proposal 
submission only if such arrangements are required or strongly encouraged by the sponsorâ€™s 
program guidelines.  During the early stages of proposal development, a prospective Principal 
Investigator/Project Director anticipating a need for cost sharing should work closely with Office 
of Research and Sponsored Programs staff to identify sources for cost sharing, and should begin 
the process of securing agreements to cost share and making arrangements for documentation. 
 
All University cost sharing commitments must be entered and approved by all cognizant officials 
on the UM Transmittal Sheet for the proposal and for any subsequent revisions to the proposal. 
 
If the project is funded, the cost sharing included in the final approved budget (as reflected on the 
final approved Transmittal Sheet) must be fully documented throughout the program period.
