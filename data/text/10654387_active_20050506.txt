Confidentiality 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Students, Faculty and Staff have the right to Confidentiality. 
 

The UCC protects the confidentiality of clients in all aspects of service, including 
communication with clients, management of files and case consultation except where written 
permission to release information has been obtained or when a release of information is 
specifically required by law.  These situations could include threat to injure or harm self or 
others, revealing information regarding observed abuse, neglect or molestation of minors or 
vulnerable adults or when ordered by the court.  All clients are made aware of policies regarding 
confidentiality.
