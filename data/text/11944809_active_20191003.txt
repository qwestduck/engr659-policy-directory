LOCKOUTS 

 

Summary/Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to identify the process and associated charges 

when a resident is locked out of their room and needs a staff member to provide access. 

 

Residents are expected to keep their university ID cards, which provide access, with them at all 

times. Residents who do not honor this expectation will be charged each time a housing staff 

member has to provide them access to their rooms. 

 

Charges will be handled as follows: 

• $5 charge for a lockout at any time of day 
• Charge will be added to resident’s bursar account immediately upon request for access to 

their room 

• If residents lose their university ID, temporary access cards will be provided. Residents 
must return the temporary access cards by the dates specified at the time provided. 

Residents who fail to return temporary access cards will be charged $10 per card. 

PROCEDURE 

Residents who are locked out of their rooms must do the following: 

• Visit the front desks of their assigned building and request lockout service 
• Show a photo ID or be checked against a photo roster to ensure identity 
• Electronically acknowledge the charge for a lockout 
• Wait for available housing staff to be contacted; staff may take up to 30 minutes to arrive
