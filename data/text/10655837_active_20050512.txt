Separation from Employment 

Summary/Purpose: Guidelines and procedures are given to use when an employee intends to 
resign his/her position. 

A non-contractual employee who intends to resign his/her position is expected to discuss the 
matter frankly with the department head as far in advance as possible of the date he/she 
contemplates leaving. The department head will see that the matter is handled in good faith and 
in the best interest of all concerned. The employee, when resigning voluntarily, should give one 
month's notice in writing to the employer. A copy of this notice should be mailed to the Director 
of Human Resources. In turn, the University will give one month's notice to the employee unless 
the employee is terminated for cause. Conditions for those under formal contract are written in 
the document itself.
