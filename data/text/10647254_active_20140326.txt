Inventory Repairs 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Property in need of repair or warranty replacement that must be sent off 

campus. 

 

 

 

When departments have property in need of repair or warranty replacement that must be sent off 

campus, they should complete a Return Request identifying the following:  

1. Where the property should be sent  

2. Whether it is a replacement, return, or repair of property  

3. Property number assigned to piece of equipment  

The department should also complete an Equipment Loan Form with an explanation.  The 

vendor should be listed in the borrowing section of this form. The loan form should be sent to the 

University Property Office along with the Return Request.  

If the item(s) are being replaced, the label must be removed and attached to the Return Request.  

Once the replacement item(s) is received, the department is responsible for notifying the 

University Property Office so that the new information on the item(s) may be obtained and the 

label reattached.
