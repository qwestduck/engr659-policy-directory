Security Grates/Screens 

The security grates, which cover the first floor windows of most of the residence halls, have been 

installed to increase the safety of all residents. In order to maintain security the grates are to remain 

closed and locked at all times. Residents are not to open the security grates in non-emergency 

situations. The penalty for opening a grate in non-emergency situations is $100. Tampering with or 

removing a window screen is also prohibited.
