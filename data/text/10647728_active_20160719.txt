Use of Protective Gloves Outside of the Laboratory 
 

Summary/Purpose:  The Policy on the Use of Protective Gloves Outside of the Laboratory 
details the minimum requirements and procedures for the removal of protective gloves prior to 
exiting a laboratory. 
 

Use of Protective Gloves Outside of the Laboratory  

Laboratory gloves worn in chemical, biological or radiological work areas must be removed before leaving the 
laboratory setting.  

Within the laboratory, gloves are used to prevent contamination between hazardous materials and individuals. 
Improper use of gloves outside of the laboratory setting may become a source of contamination to others. Even 
"clean" gloves can cause uneasiness and apprehension in others when worn outside of the work area.  

Gloves should not remain on your hands when exiting the work area (including crossing the hallways), when 
answering the telephone, when opening or using uncontaminated equipment, or when touching door handles. 

 Contaminated materials should not be removed from the laboratory without overpacking the container. This simple 
procedure will reduce the potential for accidental exposures and eliminate the need for gloves when traveling 
between laboratories.
