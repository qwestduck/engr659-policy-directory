Presentation of Identification
 
DSA.SC.200.001
 

Summary/Purpose: To provide students notice of the responsibility to present University 
identification to authorized University personnel upon request. 

In order to identify community members, the University issues each student an identification 
card at the time of enrollment. Students must be in possession of their University identification 
cards at all times, and they may be asked to present their identification cards to enter and/or 
participate in University sponsored events. 

Students at the University of Mississippi are required to present their University identification to 
authorized University personnel upon request. Examples of authorized University personnel 
include, but are not limited to, the following: University Police Officers, security officials, 
faculty, staff, and residence hall staff. Students who fail to present University identification to 
any University official may be subject to conduct charges and proceedings. 

Any misuse of a student identification card by its holder, or the use or attempted use by another 
person, may result in cancellation of privileges and/or conduct charges and proceedings. The loss 
or theft of student identification cards should be reported immediately to the I.D. Center, and a 
replacement card will be issued (a fee may be charged for this service).
