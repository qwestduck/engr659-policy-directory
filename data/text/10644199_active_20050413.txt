The University of Mississippi 

Account Deficits 
 

Summary/Purpose:  All University accounts must have a positive cash balance. 
A deficit cash balance in an account is expressly prohibited.  At such time that an 
unauthorized deficit occurs, each department/school will be asked to identify 
another account which will be charged.  If the department/school has not 
identified another account, or if the designated account is already in deficit, the 
account in deficit will be reported to the Dean's Office or appropriate Vice 
Chancellor who will be asked to provide an account number from which funds 
can be transferred to cover the deficit.
