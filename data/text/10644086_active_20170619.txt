Effort Certification for Nonexempt Employees 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Effort directly charged to, or cost shared on, federal or state funded 
sponsored projects must be certified through the university's electronic effort reporting system.  
Using suitable means of verification, Principal Investigator(s) must certify that effort percentages 
reasonably reflect actual effort devoted to their sponsored agreement(s) by employees during the 
certification period.  There are three certification periods for the university that coincide with the 
spring, summer and fall academic semesters. 
 
Effort is reported as a percentage of total activities, not of total hours worked. Therefore, all of an 
employee's compensated activities equal 100% effort regardless of the number of hours worked per 
week in which the activities are accomplished. Employees working 100% on sponsored projects must 
ensure they are not performing any other university duties without adjusting their effort accordingly 
to reflect those duties. 
 
Effort certifications must be completed within a reasonable time (typically within 60 days after the 
end of the certification period). Failure to certify effort on a timely basis may result in project 
accounts being locked pending receipt of the reports.  
 
Adjustments or cost transfers of wages should be timely processed before the end of the certification 
period. Once a certification period has ended, adjustments or cost transfers must be made via the 
effort certification process. Payroll distribution and effort as certified must be within a 5% variance.
