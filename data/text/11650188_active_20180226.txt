Blackboard Course Re moval Policy 
 
 
Summary/Purpose: This policy defines the length of time that old course information is 

stored in Blackboard. 

 
GENERAL INFORMATION: 

 
Blackboard courses with a Course ID that includes a semester designation (e.g. 2016-2017 

FALL) will be deleted 4 years after the course has been completed. This is necessary in order 

to free up system resources.  The deletion of old courses will occur annually during the month 

of May. 

 
EXAMPLES: 

 
Spring 2015-2016 courses in Blackboard will be deleted in May 2020.  Fall 2016-2017 courses 

in Blackboard will be deleted in May 2021. 
 
Note: In order to save a copy of course content, instructors can Export their course using the 
"Export/Archive Course" feature located under the Packages and Utilities option in the course 

control panel. The resulting export (.zip) file can then be saved to a local computer. Course 

exports do not contain student work such as journal entries, discussion forum postings, grades, or 

assignment submissions. If an instructor needs to save this information, it must be done 

manually. Instructors can use the "Work Offlineâ€“Download" feature located in the Grade Center 

to retain a copy of student grades. 
 
EXCEPTIONS: 

 
If a course is not tied to a specific semester (e.g. Applied Sciences Research Series ORG, 

ISHS, IS, etc.), it will not be included in the yearly course cleanup cycle. If an instructor would 

like a course removed from Blackboard prior to the 4 year cleanup cycle, the instructor may 

email the Course ID to  blackboard@olemiss.edu to request its deletion.
