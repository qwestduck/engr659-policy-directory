Hazardous Waste Identification 

Summary/Purpose:  The Hazardous Waste Identification Policy details the minimum 
requirements and procedures to properly identify and classify Chemical and Hazardous Waste 
materials.  

Hazardous Waste Identification 

What is a Hazardous Waste  

The disposal of hazardous chemicals is strictly regulated under the Resource Conservation and 
Recovery Act (RCRA), the Mississippi Hazardous Waste Management Regulations, and the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations CFR 40, parts 100 - 399. Individuals who 
do not follow procedures in complying with state and federal regulations are individually 
responsible for possible fines and/or imprisonment.  

According to RCRA, a Hazardous waste is a solid, a semi-solid, a liquid, or a contained gas 
that, "because of its quantity, concentration, or physical, chemical, or infectious 
characteristics, it may cause, or significantly contribute to, an increase in mortality or an 
increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible, illness or pose a substantial 
present or potential hazard to human health and the environment when improperly 
treated, stored, transported, or disposed of, or otherwise managed. " 

There are tens of thousands of wastes that can be hazardous for many different reasons. RCRA 
regulations identify hazardous wastes based on their physical characteristics and also provide 
lists of specific hazardous wastes. EPA regulations require that all waste generators evaluate 
their wastes to determine if any of the four hazardous characteristics are exhibited.  

Characteristic Wastes  

A waste is hazardous if it exhibits one or more of the following characteristics: 

• Ignitability EPA waste code D001 - Ignitable wastes can create fires under certain
conditions. These materials give off heat, smoke, soot and may disperse toxic pollutants
and by-products into the air. Examples include liquids, such as solvents that readily catch
fire, and friction-sensitive substances. Ignitability applies if the waste is :

o A Liquid with flashpoint less than 140° F. (60° C), or
o The material is not a liquid and it can cause a fire by friction, absorption of

moisture or spontaneous chemical changes AND, when ignited burns so
vigorously and persistently that it creates a hazard, or

o The material is is an ignitable compressed gas (Flammable gas), or
o The material is an Oxidizer.

• Corrosivity EPA waste code D002 - Corrosive wastes include those that are acidic,
wastes that can cause injury to the skin or body, or destroy their own containers(corrode
metal) or other materials and be released into the environment. Corrosivity applies if the
waste is:

o Aqueous (water-based) with pH < 2.0 or pH > 12.5, or
o Liquid and corrodes steel at > 0.25 inch / year, at 55° C.

• Reactivity EPA waste code D003 - Reactive Materials can react violently or give off
poisonous gases when exposed to light, air, water or other materials. Reactivity applies if
the waste is:

o Normally Unstable and readily undergoes violent change without detonating, or
o Reacts violently with water, or is capable of generating toxic gases or vapors or

explosive mixtures when combined with water, or
o A Cyanide or Sulfide containing material capable of releasing dangerous amounts

of poisonous gas when mixed with corrosives, or
o Capable of detonation or explosive decomposition, is a DOT Forbidden, Class A,

or Class B explosive.

• Toxicity EPA waste codes D004 - D042 - Toxic wastes are harmful or fatal when
ingested or absorbed. When toxic wastes are disposed of on land, contaminated liquid
may drain (leach) from the waste and pollute ground water. Toxicity is identified through
a laboratory procedure using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) test.
If your waste contains one or more of these contaminants (pesticides, organic
constituents, metals) at or above the regulatory level, it is a hazardous waste

Underlying Constituents - Certain Trace amounts of materials, called underlying 
constituents, require additional processing to remove the contaminant(s) to a level 
called the Universal Treatment Standard (UTS)for the constituents. This table lists 
the underlying hazardous constituents for D001-D043 wastes.  

A wastewater is any waste with less than1% by weight total organic carbon 
(TOC) and less than 1% by weight total suspended solids (TSS). All other wastes 
are nonwastewater.  

Listed Wastes 

EPA has already determined that some specific wastes are hazardous. These wastes are 
now incorporated into lists published by EPA. The lists are organized into three 
categories :  



The University of Mississippi 

Page 3 of 44 

o Source-Specific Wastes EPA waste codes K001 - K148 - This list includes 
wastes from specific industries such as petroleum refining and wood preserving. 
Sludges and waste waters from treatment and production processes in these 
industries are examples of source-specific wastes.  

o Non-Specific Source Wastes EPA waste codes F001 - F039 - This list identifies 
wastes commonly produced by manufacturing and industrial processes. Examples 
from this list include spent halogenated solvents used in degreasing and 
wastewater treatment sludges from electroplating processes as well as dioxin 
wastes, most of which are acutely hazardous wastes due to the danger they present 
to human health and the environment. 

o Commercial Chemical Products P list (Acutely Hazardous) and U list - This list 
includes specific commercial chemical products such as creosote and some 
pesticides. 

If your wastes material exhibits any of the four characteristics, or if it is a listed waste (F, 
K, P, or U list), it is a Hazardous Waste and it is subject to EPA's Subtitle C hazardous 
waste regulations. 

All listed wastes are presumed to be hazardous regardless of their concentrations and 
must be handled according to EPA's Subtitle C hazardous waste regulations.

Underlying Constituents 

This lists the Universal Treatment Standard (UTS) constituents and their 
wastewater and nonwastewater treatment standards. Use this table to identify the 

underlying hazardous constituents for D001-D043 wastes.  

A wastewater is any waste with less than1% by weight total organic carbon (TOC) 
and less than 1% by weight total suspended solids (TSS). All other wastes are 

nonwastewater.
