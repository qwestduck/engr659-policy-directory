Summary/Purpose:  Unemployment compensation is provided for University of Mississippi 
employees under the Mississippi Employment Security Law.  An explanation of how employees 
qualify for these benefits is given. 

University of Mississippi employees are provided unemployment compensation coverage under 
the Mississippi Employment Security Law. Unemployment compensation is intended to provide 
a reduced level of compensation to employees who become unemployed or laid off from work 
who meet specified conditions of eligibility. The primary reason employees qualify for these 
benefits is "lack of work." Other reasons may qualify an individual for benefits, but the final 
determination is made by the Mississippi Employment Security Commission.
