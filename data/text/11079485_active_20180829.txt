Alcohol and Other Drugs Sanctioning Policy 
 
Summary/Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to set forth the sanctioning philosophy 

and range of possible outcomes for students and recognized student organizations found 

in violation of any University alcohol or drug policy. 

 

Alcohol and illegal drugs are inherently dangerous. The University recognizes that the 

abuse and misuse of alcohol and drugs can cause significant harm to students, student 

organizations, and the University community. The University values a safe and 

welcoming learning environment. As a result, the philosophy of the Alcohol and Other 

Drugs Sanctions Policy is based upon education, rehabilitation, and the health and safety 

of students and the larger university community. 
 

Policy:  Any student or student group found in violation of a University policy regarding 

the use of alcohol or other drugs shall be subject to a range of possible outcomes that 

include but are not limited to: expulsion, suspension, probation, suspension of a student 

groups’ social activities, community service, and/or participation in an alcohol/drug 

education program for which there could be fees or fines. 

 

To determine the appropriate sanction for a particular student or student organization, 

the Office of Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct will consider the totality of the 

circumstances giving rise or related to the infraction, along with the following factors: 

 

• the severity of the infraction, 
 

• the likelihood that alcohol and drug education will minimize the risk of repeat 
violations, 

 

• the scope of the damage or harm the infraction caused, 
 

• the likelihood that substance abuse/misuse education will encourage responsible 
behavior, 

 

• the benefits gained from restorative reconciliation where the student or student 
group: (i)  accepts and acknowledges responsibility for the violation, and (ii) 

works to rebuild trust with the university community through positive social 

behaviors, such as community service and other rehabilitative exercises, and  

 

• whether the removal of the student or student group from the University 
community on a permanent or temporary basis is necessary to sustain a healthy 

and safe campus environment. 



 
The above sanctions are appealable using the University’s published student 

conduct process. Students who are suspended or expelled from the University 
should be aware that this action may impact the following: 
 

 tuition, residence hall costs and fees (suspension does not forgive financial 

obligations) 

 student financial aid 

 athletics participation and eligibility 

 health insurance (students are encouraged to contact their personal health care 

provider) 

 University housing 

 meal plan 

 use of University resources and access to University facilities 

 immigration status for international students 

 veterans and dependents of veterans 

 internships, assistantships, and study abroad 

 

The above list is not a complete list and does not include all potential consequences for 

suspension or expulsion. 

 

The University may bring a charge under this policy against any student or student 

group committing any alcohol or drug-related offense that is otherwise sanctionable 

under the University’s conduct policy describing the authority and jurisdiction of the 

University’s conduct system. For students, such offenses include but are not limited to 

any drug-related crime, public intoxication, and driving under the influence of drugs or 

alcohol when the University is made aware of such offenses. 

 

If the University brings a charge against a student based upon the student’s criminal 

conviction by any trial court of competent jurisdiction or other court proceeding that 

includes an admission or finding of guilt, the admission or finding may be accepted as a 

final factual determination that the student has violated applicable University policy, 

and the sole function of the University’s conduct process will be to determine the 

appropriate University sanction under this and other University policies.
