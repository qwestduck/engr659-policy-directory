Pets 
 

Summary/Purpose:  In the residence halls and apartments, the only pets allowed are fish in 
aquariums. This policy explains the expectations for fish and the sanctions prescribed for 
violations of the pet policy.   
  
The only pets that are allowed in residence halls are water-breathing fish.  Fish aquariums are 
permitted as long as the tank is kept in sanitary condition.  Dogs, cats, snakes, iguanas, spiders, 
etc. are not permitted.  Should students be housing a pet other than fish, a $25 per day fine will 
be assessed with the understanding that the pet will be removed within 24 hours.  In addition, 
should mites, fleas, etc result from the illegal harboring of a pet, cost of extermination will be 
assessed to the student.
