Electrical Outlets 
 

Summary/Purpose:  This policy defines the expectations for electrical outlet and extension cord 
use in residential facilities. 
 
Residents will refrain from creating an environment potentially hazardous to the community.  
 
Power strips with surge protection are the only multi-outlet devices allowed. Extension cords 
are NOT permitted in any residential facility. The university will not accept responsibility for 
damages to electronics due to interruptions in utilities services.  
 
The electrical circuits in apartments are controlled by circuit breakers. In the event that a circuit 
becomes overloaded, the circuit breaker will automatically turn off. Repeated overloading will 
damage the circuit breaker. If the circuit breaker continues to turn off, residents should 
immediately report it to a student housing staff member. Residents may not place anything 
over the circuits.
