ROOM CHANGES 

 

Purpose/Summary: This policy explains the procedures necessary for students to change 

their rooms.  

 

In order to stabilize residence hall occupancy, there will be no room changes processed during 

the first week of each semester. During the second week of classes, should space be available, in-

hall room changes will be processed. The following week, building to building room changes 

will be processed. More information will be posted at that time directing students who to speak 

with to request a change.  

 

A room-change form is required prior to moving. After the room change period ends, room 

changes will be granted only if there are extenuating circumstances and the room change is 

approved by a professional staff member. Unfinished or unauthorized room changes will result in 

a fine of no less than $25 per day, and the student may be required to move back into his/ her 

original room.  

 

To complete a room change, students must officially check out of their old room and into their 

new room with a Student Housing staff member. Please note that students assigned into 

temporary housing are given priority over other room change requests.
