Payment of Tuition and Expenses 
 

Summary/Purpose:  The University of Mississippi Bursar’s policy on billing dates and service 
fees for tuition and expenses. 
 
 
The Office of the Bursar emails statements monthly on accounts that have outstanding balances.  
These statements are emailed after month end with a due date of the 15th of the next month.  The 
billing and due dates for tuition and fees (housing, meal plan, special course fees, international 
student fees/insurance, and registration fees) occur on the following dates (or the previous 
working day if the due date falls on a weekend or holiday): 
 
Enrollment Period     Billing Date  Due Date 
Fall Semester (including 1st Fall & 2nd Fall)  July 31   August 15 
Wintersession, Spring Semester (including  
1st Spring & 2nd Spring)    November 30  December 15 
May Intersession, Full Summer, & 1st Summer April 30  May 15 
2nd Summer      May 31  June 15 
August Intersession     May 31  July 15 
 
If payment is not received by the due date, a monthly 1.5 percent service fee will be assessed on 
the unpaid balance of tuition and fees and other outstanding charges.  Partial payments may be 
made during the enrollment period; however, the account must be current in order to register for 
future enrollment periods.  “Current” means that tuition and fees for the current and previous 
enrollment periods are paid in full and all other charges are less than 30 days old.  The 
University reserves the right to cancel a student’s registration for nonpayment of tuition and fees 
for a previous enrollment period. 
 
The begin date for the calculation of the 1.5 percent service fee is the due date regardless of the 
date that a student obtains a schedule.  For example, if a student registers for the fall semester on 
August 25, and payment is not made by August 15, the student account is subject to a 1.5 percent 
service fee on the unpaid tuition and fees.
