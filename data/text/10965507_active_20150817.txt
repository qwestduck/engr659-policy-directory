Plumbing 

Summary/Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines for residents in managing 
plumbing issues in their residential facilities. 

Residents are required to act in a responsible manner in the use and treatment of university-
owned residences and immediately report any plumbing issues. 

• The placement of food or cooking items in sink drains, bathtub drains, and toilets is
strictly prohibited.

• Residents are prohibited from using chemical drain-opening products to address
drainage issues. The use of outside contractors is prohibited. All plumbing issues should
be reported to student housing via the online maintenance request process.

• Residents who are found responsible for damage to the plumbing/drainage system in a
residential facility due to improper use will be billed for repairs once a cost has been
assessed by university staff.
