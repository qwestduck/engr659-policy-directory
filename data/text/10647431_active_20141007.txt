UNIVERSITY OWNED FURNITURE 

 

Purpose/Summary: This policy describes Student Housingâ€™s expectations regarding 

furniture, both in individual rooms/apartments and public areas of residence halls. 

University-owned furniture may not be removed from residence hall rooms or apartments. 

The policy also describes sanctions for violating the policy.  

 

Residents are responsible for the furniture in their room and/or apartment. The assigned furniture 

must be kept in the room or apartment the entire academic year. Removing furniture from the 

floor lounges, laundry rooms, study rooms or other common areas for your room is not permitted 

and will result in a fine and disciplinary action. In addition, University owned furniture is not 

allowed outside the student residences. Residents who move furniture outside of their room or 

apartment will be charged for repairing/replacing the furniture, in addition to being assessed a 

fine. Students who have removed furniture from their room or apartment and find that it is 

unavailable at the time of check-out will be assessed the full replacement cost at current market 

price for those items, and face possible University judicial action for theft of University property.
