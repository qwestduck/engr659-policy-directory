UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI 
 
Summary/Purpose: This policy explains the responsibility all residents living in student housing
have with regard to the activities that take place in the residential facilities. Residents will 
refrain from facilitating a violation of university policy and/or remaining present while a 
violation is occurring (e.g. staying in a space where drugs are being consumed or being a 
spectator to an act of vandalism).   

 

 
Implied Consent 

 
Residents are responsible for all activities that occur in their assigned residential facilities, and 
they have a duty to take an active role in ensuring that inappropriate behaviors do not occur 
and illegal items and items banned by university policy are not present in their residence hall 
rooms or apartments. By allowing the presence of behaviors or items that violate student 
housing or university policy, residents demonstrate implied consent for the violations.  
Residents who demonstrate implied consent could be subject to conduct charges and 
proceedings. 
  

Passive Participation 
 
All residents are expected to remove themselves from situations in which violations of student 
housing or university policy may occur. Residents should report behaviors or items that violate 
student housing or university policy to a staff member. Residents who fail to remove 
themselves and/or report the activity will be seen as passive participants and could be subject 
to student conduct charges and proceedings.
