The University of Mississippi

RE-ADMISSION OF FORMER STUDENTS

All students who have interrupted their enrollment in the University must submit an application
for re-admission to the Office of Admissions. Those who have attended other institutions during
the interruption must have official transcripts forwarded by the institutions to the Office of
Admissions. Re-admission will be to the school or department in which the student was enrolled
during the most recent period of UM attendance. Students wishing to change majors must first be
admitted and then may meet with an adviser from the program in which they wish to enroll.
Re-admission requirements for students who have been academically suspended or dismissed from
the University are given in the Academic Standing section of the Academic Regulations chapter.
