Patent and Invention Policy - 2008 
 

Summary/Purpose:  To designate the University of Mississippi policy for Intellectual Property 
rights as they pertain to patentable materials, including Inventions, but not copyrights.   

I. Foreword  

It is the intent of the University of Mississippi in administering Intellectual Property rights for 
the public benefit to encourage and assist members of the faculty, staff, and student employees of 
the University with their discoveries and Inventions in a manner that is equitable to all parties 
involved1.  

The University recognizes the need for and desirability of encouraging the broad utilization of 
the results of University research, not only by scholars but also in practical application for the 
general public benefit, and acknowledges the importance of protecting Intellectual Property 
through patenting and other means in bringing innovative research findings to practical 
application.  The objectives of this policy are to encourage the practical application of University 
research for the broad public benefit; to facilitate and manage the patent application and 
prosecution process, the licensing process, and the equitable distribution of Licensing Income, if 
any; to provide for the use of Licensing Income for the further support of research and education 
in accordance with state and federal policies, laws and regulations; and to provide incentives and 
assistance to University Employees to develop and commercialize technology for the benefit of 
the University Employee, the University and the public.

III. Scope 
 

This policy covers all Intellectual Property, except copyright, which is covered in the University 
of Mississippi’s Copyright Policy (Reference: UM Policy RSP.TM.400.001).  Software that 
qualifies as an Invention under this policy is covered in this policy if a patent application is filed 
to protect the software.  Copyright protection of software is covered in the Copyright Policy 
(UM Policy RSP.TM.400.001).  Ownership rights to Inventions emerging from activity 
pursuant to an agreement with an outside sponsor shall be determined in accordance with that 
agreement, or, in the absence of a controlling agreement, with rules and regulations, if any, 
governing that sponsorship.   
 
IV. University Employee Responsibilities 

 
A. Research Disclosure.  All University Employees who create an Invention that may 

have commercial value are obligated to disclose such Inventions to the DTM if the 
activity was part of their Educational and Research Activities or if the activity was 
outside their Educational and Research Activities and involved Substantial Use of 
University Resources.  University Employees should use a Research Disclosure 
Form to report an Invention.  The Research Disclosure Form may be updated by the 
University at any time.  A Research Disclosure should be submitted to the DTM well 
in advance of making a public disclosure of the potential Invention to protect 
patentability of the potential Invention (Reference: DTM Procedure on Filing and 
Processing Research Disclosures). 

B. Assignment of Rights.  The University shall have ownership of any Invention made 
or developed in the course of the Educational and Research Activities of all 
University Employees and whenever any Invention is made or developed outside the 
University Employee’s Educational and Research Activities but involved Substantial 
Use of University Resources.  Each University Employee is required to assign to the 
University all domestic and foreign rights to any such Invention including United 
States and International patent applications and issued patents (collectively “Patents”) 
unless the University releases the rights to the University Employee (Reference:  
DTM Procedure on Release of Rights). 

C. Confidentiality.  While the University adheres to a principle of free and open 
publication, there are instances in which confidentiality is necessary and appropriate.   
All University Employees who wish to engage in discussions with personnel outside 
the University that may lead to patentable Inventions or Trade Secrets, or involve 
confidential discussions of Intellectual Property of either party, are obligated to have 
such discussions under the terms of a Confidential Disclosure Agreement (“CDA”,

also known as a Non-Disclosure Agreement or an "NDA").  The University 
Employee must request execution of a CDA using a Request to Draft Confidential 
Disclosure Agreement Form. The signatory authority for CDAs involving research 
activities is the Vice Chancellor for Research and Sponsored Programs.  The 
University Employee is required to acknowledge the CDA and to notify other 
University Employees involved in such discussions that they must abide by the terms 
of the CDA.   

D. Cooperation. All University Employees who submit a Research Disclosure are 
obligated to make reasonable efforts to assist the DTM in carrying out the work 
required to patent, market, license, or otherwise commercialize the Invention.      

 
 
 

V. University Responsibilities 
 
A. Research Disclosure.  The DTM will assist University Employees in completing a 

Research Disclosure Form.  University Employees are encouraged to discuss their 
ideas with the DTM at an early stage of the research. (Reference:  DTM Procedure 
on Filing and Processing Research Disclosures). 

B. Timely Determination of Interest.  The DTM is obligated to review the Research 
Disclosure in a timely manner and to communicate next steps to the University 
Employee(s). (References:  DTM Procedure on Filing and Processing Research 
Disclosures; DTM Flowchart on Filing and Processing Research Disclosures).  

C. Reasonable Efforts to Commercialize. The DTM is obligated to use reasonable 
efforts to identify a commercial partner for any technology for which the University 
has ownership rights and to negotiate licensing terms that are fair and equitable to all 
parties involved.  Such terms may include but not be limited to upfront payments, 
milestone payments, royalty on sales and Equity.  Equity may be held by the 
University of Mississippi Research Foundation.   

D. Release of Rights.  The University is obligated to offer to release the rights, in 
writing, to the University Employee(s) if the University decides not to pursue or 
maintain Patent protection or wishes to discontinue efforts to commercialize the 
technology (Reference: DTM Procedure on Release of Rights). 

E. Determination of Inventors and Non-Inventors – Inventorship on a patent is 
determined according to United States patent law.  The DTM will work with patent 
counsel to determine if a University Employee is an Inventor of an issued patent or 
likely to be an Inventor of a pending patent application.  (Reference: DTM 
Procedure on Determination of Inventors and Distribution of Licensing Income).  

F. Licensing Income Sharing – Subject to restrictions arising from overriding 
obligations of the University pursuant to gifts, grants, contracts, or other agreements 
with outside entities, the University will, following assignment of Inventions and 
patent rights by the Inventor(s) to the University, distribute Net Licensing Income as 
follows:

10% to support Inventor(s) research program 
15% to the Inventor(s) Department or Center 
  5% to the Inventor(s) Dean’s Office 
40% to the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs 
 
This distribution formula may be changed for a specific Invention with the approval 
in writing of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Sponsored Programs (Reference:  
DTM Procedure on Determination of Inventors and Distribution of Licensing 
Income).  
 
Multiple Inventors will share Net Licensing Income equally unless a different 
distribution arrangement is agreed upon in writing by all the Inventors and Net 
Licensing Income may be shared with a Non-Inventor(s) in rare occasions. 
(Reference:  DTM Procedure on Determination of Inventors and Distribution of 
Licensing Income). 
 
Distribution of proceeds derived from liquidating Equity will be determined 
according to the specific circumstances of the Equity arrangement (Reference:  DTM 
Procedure on Distribution of Equity). 
 

VI. Agreement to the Policy 
 
This policy is binding on the University and on University Employees as a condition of 
their employment by the University. 
  

VII.  Disputes  
 

The Vice Chancellor of Research and Sponsored Programs will have authority to settle any 
disputes and may do so in accordance with the DTM Procedure on Dispute Resolution.
