Capital Planning Process Policy

Summary/Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to define the procedure for the capital planning 
process.   
 
 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
 
The University of Mississippi desires to have a collaborative and comprehensive capital planning 
process for the initiation and approval of major projects.  A key goal of the Chancellor’s Capital 
Planning Council (Council) is to review and process proposed capital planning projects through a 
prescribed consistent methodology for all campuses.  This procedure will ensure the University 
is prepared to deploy funding as it becomes available.  Membership of the Council will be 
comprised of the Chancellor’s Senior Leadership Group. 
 
While final approval must come from the Mississippi Board of Trustees for the Institutions of 
Higher Learning (IHL), the Council will determine the pre-requisites for projects submitted for 
IHL approval. Recognizing, however, that it will be necessary to maintain some flexibility to 
meet restrictions associated with certain funding.  
 
The following are examples of projects that will be submitted to the Council, but is not all 
encompassing: 
 

1. All new construction with a total estimated value of $2,500,000 or more. 
2. All major repair or renovation projects, including infrastructure, with a total estimated 

value of $2,500,000 or more. 
3. All new uses of University land. This includes any outdoor structure, signage changes, 

artwork, or improvements. 
4. Naming of buildings. Building naming has historically been reserved for recognition of 

persons that have contributed in a meaningful way to the facility project, the university, 
or have made significant cumulative lifetime donations.    

5. All Fraternity & Sorority Life (FSL) renovations and construction. 
6. All projects with private funding. 
7. Street naming. 
8. Any project added by a member of the Council.  

 
The capital planning process will provide for the presentation of potential projects in an orderly 
fashion. The process will allow assessment of a project’s ability to meet the needs of the 
University and may include, but not be limited to, consideration of the following factors:  
 

1. Consistency with the University’s Mission; 
2. Consistency with the University’s Strategic and Master Plans; 
3. Funding sources; and 
4. Sustainability of funding sources.

CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESS: 
 
A. Preliminary Consideration 
 

1. A project sponsor will submit a completed Capital Project Initiation form with the 
Department Chair/Director, Dean/AVC, and Provost/Vice Chancellor’s signatures to 
Facilities Planning.    

2. The Council will consider all new capital projects at its regularly scheduled Senior 
Leadership Group meetings.   

3. After consideration of each project, the Council may recommend approval, deny, request 
additional information, set financial and funding parameters, or take further action as 
appropriate.   

 
B. Planning, Design, and Construction Approval 

 
1. Once preliminary consideration has been approved, a project may proceed through 

planning and design phases in order to develop realistic renderings and accurate estimates 
for total project costs.   

2. Once planning and design is complete, projects will come back before Council.  The 
Council may again recommend approval, deny, request additional information, set 
financial and funding parameters, or take further action as appropriate.   

3. Approved projects may move forward from this point commensurate with satisfactory 
attainment of financial or design metrics that have been stipulated by the Council. 

 
C. Final authority rests with the Chancellor.
