Electronic Surveillance Devices 
 

Summary/Purpose:   This policy establishes general guidelines for the use of electronic 

surveillance devices for observations and recordings on the Oxford campus for the purposes of 

safety and security and the enforcement of university policies and procedures. The policy also 

defines the limitations of the use of such devices to respect and preserve individual privacy.  

 

General: 

 

This policy defines the purposes for monitoring, the authorization process, the standards for 

equipment, and practices for monitoring and recording. Because one of the primary purposes of 

the use of surveillance devices is to ensure safety and security,  

         the University Police Department, UPD, plays a key role in authorizing, having access 

to, and determining the dissemination and retention of recordings; and 

         an adequate degree of standardization is required, to assure that the recording can be 

used for these purposes. 

The policy is primarily focused on video surveillance but also applies to other types of electronic 

recordings. 

 

The following are guidelines that must be followed: 

 Departments will identify the requirements and provide justification to the University Police 
Department (“UPD”) in determining if recording hardware is required in the department. 

 Departments wanting video recorded in a central location must discuss the one-time as well 
as annual costs with the department director, chair and dean. University Centralized 

recording will be performed through Contractual Services, unless approved by UPD. 

 Camera systems not currently capable of web monitoring should be upgraded to provide this 

capability. Cameras will be installed if properly justified for security and control reasons. In 

general, cameras cannot be installed in any area where a person has a reasonable expectation 

of privacy unless being used for criminal investigations, or non-criminal investigations of situations 
which may be a significant risk to public safety and security as authorized by UPD or designee. UPD 

will maintain an inventory of video surveillance equipment installed pursuant to this procedure. 

Examples Include:  

o Student rooms in the Residence Halls 
o Bathrooms 
o Single Occupancy Offices 
o Locker Rooms 
o Health Treatment Rooms 

 UPD can authorize removal of any camera. 

 The installation of  a “dummy” camera is prohibited 

 All existing uses of security camera systems will be required to comply with the policy upon 
system renewal or replacement. 

 

Standards: 

 

Following are the minimum standards that a camera system must have:

 Web based – cameras can be monitored via the web. 

 Recording equipment must be capable of accepting all recognized camera brand names. 

 Recorded files must be retained for a minimum of 30 days and must retain files for a 
longer period of time if the files are part of a criminal investigation, court proceeding, or 

other internal university investigation. 

 Video footage will be stored in a secured location. 

 Purchase of hardware must be approved by UPD. 
 

 

Authorization Process: 

 

 Departments requesting installation of security cameras  inside or outside of a building must 

follow these procedures: 

 Approval of the department director, chair or dean.  
1. Written request signed by the department director, chair or dean must be forwarded to 

UPD (see Appendix A).  

2. Once approved, UPD will assign a tracking number and return a copy of the approved 
document to the requesting department.  

 Written approval from UPD must be maintained in the departmental office. Purchase 
hardware, software and installation services through normal procurement procedures. 

Procurement must have written approval (see Appendix A) signed by the department 

director, chair or dean and UPD before they will process requisition for equipment. 

Equipment purchased without this approval will be paid for by the person ordering the 

equipment. 

 

 

Viewing of Video: 

 

To view information recorded in a location, the following procedures will be followed: 

 Only people designated  by UPD, the director, dean or chair of department are authorized 
to view video from the camera.  

 All camera systems must be configured to provide viewing capabilities to UPD.  

 All legal requests for footage from outside the University must be approved by UPD and 
the University Legal Office. 

 No attempt shall be made to alter or delete any part of any video surveillance recording. 

 All authorized users must sign a terms of use and non-disclosure agreement (see Appendix B). 
 

Monitoring of Cameras: 

 

 Monitoring, recording, or both will be decided by the owner, department, or organization 
of the camera system and must be approved by UPD 

 It is the department director, chair or dean responsibility to control access to monitoring 
of video that is maintained in the departmental office. 

 University security cameras are not actively monitored under normal operating conditions 
but may be monitored for legitimate safety and security purposes that include, but are not

limited to, the following: high risk areas, restricted access/locations, in response to an 

alarm, special events, and specific events, and specific investigations authorized by UPD 

or designee. 

 

 

Installation and Maintenance: 

 

Departments must assume the following responsibilities related to maintenance and installation: 

 UPD will perform the departmental assessment regarding the use, placement, 
authorization and paperwork about the cameras. 

 Departments will be responsible for all costs related to purchase, installation, monitoring, 
software, annual costs (if applicable) and network services – if necessary. 

 Departments will be responsible for maintenance of camera systems. All systems must be 
maintained or removed from service. Service and maintenance will be paid for by the 

department owning the cameras and equipment. The department will decide whether this 

will be done internally or externally. 

 Cameras and other associated equipment will be listed on the departmental property 
inventory equipment list and is the responsibility of the requesting department to keep 

track of for auditing purposes. 

 Departments seeking to acquire video surveillance equipment that will be connected to 
the University System must contact the Department of Contractual Services for vendors 

and cost analysis. 

 Contractual Services will be responsible for periodic site visits and maintenance checks 
of cameras and equipment for only those systems connected to the ID system.  

 Contractual Services will bill annually for maintenance based on the type, size, and 
complexity of the system connected to the ID System. Annual fees should be considered 

during the authorization/approval phase prior to the purchase and/or installation. 

 Telecommunications will install the wiring or fiber to connect cameras and equipment on 
a time and material basis. Repairs to wiring or fiber will be on a time and material basis. 

The installation work order must contain the approval tracking number for each camera.  

 Notify UPD when installation is complete.
