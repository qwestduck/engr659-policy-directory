Unallowable Entertainment Expenditures 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Categories and descriptions of entertainment expenditures that cannot be 
reimbursed. 
 
 

• Departmental social functions in celebration of an event or a holiday, or to promote 
fellowship among constituents are not reimbursable. Examples include introduction of 
new staff and Christmas parties. 

• Entertainment expenditures are prohibited for alcoholic beverages, bartenders, golf green 
fees, boat rentals, private club dues, or civic group functions. 

• Flowers, fruit baskets, or other related items for individuals. 
• Expressions of sympathy. 
 

This list is not exclusive but is meant to suggest the types of expenditures that may be 
prohibited. To prevent potential reimbursement problems, the department might wish to 
consult with the Office of Procurement Services before making an expenditure not 
addressed in these guidelines to determine if the expenditure is within the University's 
fiscal policies.
