The University of Mississippi 

Membership Dues 
 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Instances where membership dues may be paid with university funds. 
 
 
The University encourages faculty and staff membership in organizations that will promote 
advancement of instruction, research, public service, and enhance the professional standing and 
development of its faculty and staff. With the approval of the dean or corresponding non-
academic department head, faculty and staff memberships that are within the guidelines outlined 
below may be paid for with available departmental funds. Memberships should be in the name of 
the University of Mississippi to be represented by the individual. 
 
Faculty and staff memberships paid with university funds should benefit the division/department 
in terms of its mission. These benefits should include receipt of scholarly journals, professional 
publications, employment information, professional development contacts, and exchange of 
information with other professionals in the area of interest. Only memberships in organizations 
that do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, sex, age, color, national origin, or 
individual handicap will be approved. 
 
An Attorney General's ruling allows only one membership per city for Chambers of Commerce. 
These memberships must be in the name of the University with no benefits accruing to any 
particular individual or department. 
 
Vice chancellors or department heads may establish more restrictive guidelines for the payment 
of individual memberships. 
 
Payment of dues may be processed on a Request for Payment form or by the procurement card. 
The dean or the corresponding non-academic department head must approve the Request for 
Payment form.
