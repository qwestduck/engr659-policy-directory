Computation of Terminal Pay for Hourly Employees 
 

Summary/Purpose:  The calculation method or formula is given to demonstrate how terminal 
leave pay is determined for hourly employees. 
 
 
Terminal leave pay is calculated by multiplying the hourly rate by the number of hours 
available.  For example, if an employee had 120 hours of unused Personal Leave on the date of 
termination, the employee's hourly rate would be multiplied by 120 in order to calculate the 
terminal leave pay portion of his or her terminal pay.
