Interim Measures While Charges Pending
 
DSA.SC.300.030
 

Under ordinary circumstances, a student charged with a violation of University policy shall 
remain free to attend class and engage in all other University functions and activities while 
conduct charges are pending. However, some or all of a studentâ€™s privileges may be limited or 
suspended by the Assistant Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Dean of Students on an 
interim basis, pending the outcome of any University conduct process. The Assistant Vice 
Chancellor for Student Affairs and Dean of Students may limit or suspend student privileges 
when he or she determines that it is necessary to do so for any of the following reasons: 

(1)	 To prevent a hostile environment; 
(2)	 To ensure the safety and well-being of a member of the University 

community; 
(3)	 To protect the property of the University or of other members of the 

University community; or 
(4)	 If there is a substantial likelihood that the charged student poses a threat of 

disruption or interference with the effective operation of the University. 

Examples of interim measures the Assistant Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Dean of 
Students may take include, but are not limited to, the following: an interim suspension, no 
contact orders, change in class or work schedule, restriction of access to University facilities or 
activities, housing relocation, and behavioral agreements. An interim measure does not replace 
the regular University conduct process, which shall proceed in the normal course up to and 
through a University conduct hearing and appeal, if applicable.
