University of Mississippi Freshman Residency Requirement: Students who have 
fewer than 30 semester hours are required to live on campus for two consecutive 
semesters - Fall and Spring or Spring and Full Summer (Summer I and Summer II).  
 
If the student will still be classified as a freshman after completing the stated 
requirement, then student housing must be notified by July 15th to ensure that a housing 
exemption is placed on the student’s account for the following fall. This allows the 
student to avoid charges from student housing.  
 
Housing exemptions are approved for the following: 

 Students who are 21 years of age or older 

 Students who live with parents or legal guardians and commute within a radius of 
60 miles (proof required) 

 Students who have graduated from high school at least one year prior to 
enrollment at  the university and have lived in a campus residential community 
(proof required) 

 Married students (proof required) 

 Students with children (proof required). 
 
Others who feel that special circumstances may entitle them to an exception should 
mail an appeal letter and all exemption documents no later than July 1 to:  
 
Housing Appeals Committee 
Department of Student Housing 
P.O. Box 1848 
University, MS 38677. 
 
Unmarried freshmen (except commuters living with parents or guardians) who enroll 
and are found to be living off campus without an authorized exemption from the Housing 
Appeals Committee will be administratively charged for housing.
