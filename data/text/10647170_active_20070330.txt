1. PERSONAL PURCHASE(S) 
Definition:  

A personal purchase is anything that is not purchased for use and ownership by the 
University.

It is a cardholder violation to make ANY personal purchases or transactions with the 
Procurement Card or any other purchase method.  It is against the law to use government 
funds, state or federal, to purchase items for personal use.  Even though the Cardholder 
may have paid the University back, or intends to pay back the amount of the purchase, it 
may be considered a fraudulent act.  
Consequence:  
The University must be reimbursed immediately for the amount of the personal purchase.  
The Card may be canceled.  Any violation of this policy may be investigated and could 
result in termination and/or criminal prosecution.  In the event of willful or neglectful 
default of these obligations, the University shall take any recovery action deemed 
appropriate, that is permitted by law.

Cash, cash in addition to purchase, cash in lieu of credit to the account, travelers checks,

accepting cash rather than credit for returned items). 
Consequence:

result in termination and/or criminal prosecution.  In the event of willful or neglect 
default of these obligations, the University shall take any recovery action deemed 
appropriate, that is permitted by law.
