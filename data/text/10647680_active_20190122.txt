Part 2.0 Student Eligibility Overview 

 

A student must meet certain eligibility criteria to receive Federal Title IV funds (Pell 

Grant, FSEOG, TEACH, Work-Study, and Direct Loans,).  Some requirements are 

federal (i.e., U.S. citizenship, maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress, not being in 

default of a student loan), some are determined by UM (i.e., admission/enrollment 

status).

Part 2.1 Eligibility Requirements 

 

Students must submit a FAFSA in order to determine eligibility. The following list 

provides basic student eligibility requirements. The list is not exhaustive. Although each 

type of financial aid has individual awarding criteria, there are general conditions that must 

be met to receive Federal Title IV aid.  

 

Basic student eligibility requirements:  

 

 Must be enrolled as a regular student in an eligible academic program (typically 
degree-seeking, although exceptions exist for teacher certification/recertification). 

 Must declare a major within the timeframe established in UM’s policy (please refer 
to the academic catalogue).  

 Cannot also be enrolled in elementary or secondary school. 

 Must have a high school diploma or equivalent (e.g. GED) or been home-schooled 
at the secondary level. 

 Must make satisfactory academic progress.  (Refer to OFA policy “1.2 Satisfactory 
Academic Progress” for more information.) 

 Must meet enrollment status requirements (full-time, half-time, etc., as specified by 
the aid program.) 

 Must have attendance verified, at least once in each class, to confirm enrollment 
level (see OFA policy on “Go to Class” and Class Attendance Verification web 

page for more information). 

 Must have resolved any drug conviction issue.  (Refer to policy “Convicted of 
Possession/Sale of Drugs”). 

 Must not be currently incarcerated.  (There are exceptions to this rule.  Incarcerated 
students may qualify for FSEOG and Federal Work-Study, if available.  They are 

also eligible for Federal Pell Grants if not incarcerated in a federal or state prison.)  

Also, parents are not eligible for a Direct PLUS loan if incarcerated. 

 Must be confirmed as a U.S. citizen through the SSA database, OR be approved as 
a U.S. permanent resident or other eligible non-citizen through a match with 

Department of Homeland Security records. 

 Cannot be in default on an FSA loan or owe an overpayment on an FSA grant.  For 
a parent to receive a PLUS Loan, neither the parent nor the student may be in 

default or owe an overpayment on an FSA loan or grant (although a parent in 

default on a PLUS loan does not make a student ineligible for aid). 

 Must have a valid Social Security Number with a name and date of birth that 
matches information in the SSA database. 

 Must be registered with Selective Service if required to do so by law.

If any issues need to be resolved regarding these items, the student’s FAFSA will be 

flagged, which blocks awarding and disbursement of Title IV aid.  To resolve these issues, 

a student may contact the OFA or review the “FAFSA Fixes” information available at 

http://finaid.olemiss.edu/fafsa-fixes/.
