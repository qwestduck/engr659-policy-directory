Summary/Purpose:  Acquiring tags and titles for University owned vehicles.  

 

 

Vehicle Titles 

The University Property Office has been designated by the University as being the official 

depository for titles of all vehicles owned by the university. When a department receives new 

vehicles, the original title should be forwarded directly to the University Property Office. A copy 

of the title should be retained in the vehicle glove compartment. 

 

Vehicle Tags 

When departments receive new vehicles, the vehicle’s license plate is ordered at the time the 

vehicle is tagged by the University Property Office.  After the Procurement Services Department 

completes the proper paperwork and the tag is received, it will be turned over to the University 

Property Office. The University Property Office will contact the department to determine that the 

vehicle has been properly marked and that the title has been surrendered before releasing the tag.
