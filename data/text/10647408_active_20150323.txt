Transfer Residency Requirement 
 

Summary/Purpose: This policy explains the on-campus residency requirement as it specifically 
applies to transfer students.  
  
It is the policy of The University of Mississippi that all full-time single students who have fewer 
than 30 semester hours are required to live on campus at Ole Miss for one academic year (fall 
and spring semesters).  While this policy most often applies to entering freshmen, it is also true 
for any transfer student who has completed fewer than 30 academic credits prior to beginning 
their experience at Ole Miss. Exceptions are made for students who are 21 years of age or older, 
married students and for those who live with parents or legal guardians and commute. A 
commuter form must be completed and returned to the Department of Student Housing and 
Residence Life to be exempt from this policy. Students may obtain this form from the Student 
Housing office.  
Married students who have fewer than 30 academic credits should submit a copy of their 
marriage license. Parents or legal guardians of commuters should complete a Commuter Form 
and send a confirmation letter to the Department of Student Housing and Residence Life. Others 
who feel that special circumstances may entitle them to an exception should mail petitions to: 
Appeals Committee, Department of Student Housing and Residence Life, University, MS 38677 
prior to July 1 for the fall and December 1 for the spring. 
Transfer students with less than 30 semester hours who are found to be living off campus without 
an authorized exemption from the Housing Appeals Committee will be liable for the full cost of 
on-campus housing for the academic year.
