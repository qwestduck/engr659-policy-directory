Long Distance Authorization Codes 

Summary/Purpose: Defines the acquisition and use of a long distance authorization code for 
making business related long distance calls.  

A long distance authorization code is needed to make long distance calls that are not toll free (800, 
877, and so on). Please submit a request for a long distance code through the Request Services link 
on the Telecommunications website or by e-mailing telcom@olemiss.edu. This code MUST NOT be 
used for personal calls. Should a person mistakenly use a University authorization code for a personal 
call, that person should reimburse the department for the cost of the call plus 7% sales tax. 
Employees have 30 days to review and compensate the University for personal calls placed on their 
departmental long distance code. The department should deposit the funds in the departmental fund 
or cost center. Telecommunications should be notified of this mistake and credited for the taxes, 
which will be reported to the State Tax Commission.  
Departments can access the web site at http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/telecommunications/ and print 
out a copy of the monthly call detail for long distance calls. It is important that each individual check 
their phone calls for accuracy. If suspicion arises that an authorization code is being used by someone 
else, please notify the Telecommunications Center immediately and it will be removed from service. 
You will be assigned a new authorization code immediately.  

University authorization codes should be safeguarded. If you think that a code has been 
compromised, please contact the Telecommunications Center immediately.
