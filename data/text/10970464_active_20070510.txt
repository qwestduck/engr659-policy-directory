INTERNAL PROPERTY AUDITS 
 
 

Summary / Purpose: To notify university departments that annual physical inventories 
of property are required.  
 
 
The university’s Property Officer is required to perform an annual physical inventory of 
property within each department. The Property Office will attempt to schedule 
department audits so they will not interfere with normal department operations. 
Department heads will be responsible for assigning an individual with knowledge of 
equipment locations within the department to accompany the property auditor into each 
area where equipment may be located. Although the property auditor is available to assist 
in identifying all items of equipment, it is the department head’s responsibility to locate 
and identify all equipment items. The property auditor will also update the equipment’s 
location on the property records if needed. 
 
During the physical audit, the property auditor will also attach labels to any item of 
equipment or furniture purchased under the required reporting value for the primary 
inventory. 
 
After the physical inventory is completed and the Property Officer has had an opportunity 
to review the results, the Property Office will contact the department head regarding any 
missing item(s). Department heads can ask for additional time to account for the missing 
item(s), or they can request deletion of the item(s) from their inventory with the proper 
documentation. Department heads that cannot account for missing inventory and do not 
obtain approved documentation in order to delete the items from University property 
records, can be held personally liable to the University for the missing items. 
 
Procedures for deletion and transfer of equipment items are covered in related property 
policies on the UM Policy Web Site.
