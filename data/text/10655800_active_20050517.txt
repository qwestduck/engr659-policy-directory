Employee Layoffs 

Summary/Purpose:  The reasons as to when a department head may lay off a permanent 
employee along with what factors to consider in accomplishing the layoff are given. Regulations 
are also given regarding notification to the affected employee, when and how to notify the 
Department of Human Resources, and how long the layoffs should last.    

A department head may lay off a permanent employee by reason of a shortage of work or funds, 
student recesses, or other reasons that do not reflect discredit on the service of the employee. 
Layoff of personnel will be accomplished by giving consideration to such factors as (1) work 
performance, (2) seniority in length of service, and (3) other pertinent considerations. The 
employee affected should be given two weeks' notice. Layoffs should be reported immediately to 
the Department of Human Resources on an HR Form 3 for all employees. Layoffs should be for 
short periods of time, no longer than one year, with expectation of reemployment.
