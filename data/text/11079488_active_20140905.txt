Conduct Record Retention
 
DSA.SC.300.040
 

Summary/Purpose: To provide a safe and confidential disciplinary process including record 
retention. 

Hearings held through the University conduct system are closed to the public.  Suspension or 
expulsion from the University will be noted on a student’s transcript. Other sanctions will be 
noted within a student’s confidential conduct record maintained by the Office of Conflict 
Resolution and Student Conduct and the Department Student Housing.  Student conduct records 
will not be disclosed to third parties except as required or permitted under Federal or State law. 
The Office of Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct, or other appropriate hearing body or 
conduct officer, will retain conduct records for at least seven years.  Generally, conduct records 
will be reported to third parties, as permitted under law, for at least three years following a 
student’s graduation from the University or date of last attendance.
