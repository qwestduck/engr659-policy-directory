Laboratory Animal Environmental Enrichment  
 

Summary/Purpose:  Mandatory environmental enrichment materials / practices. 

The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals* states “The primary aim of 
environmental enrichment (EE) is to enhance animal well-being by providing animals with 
sensory and motor stimulation, through structures and resources that facilitate the expression of 
species-typical behaviors and promote psychology well-being through physical exercise, 
manipulative activities, and cognitive challenges according to species-specific characteristics.” 

In order to ensure animal use conforms to the Guide, EE adequacy will be reviewed by the 
IACUC in three ways: through proposed EE in animal protocol study applications, semiannual 
facility inspections, and semiannual program reviews.  Animal study protocols must have 
scientific justification, approved by the IACUC, to provide anything less than standard 
enrichment materials or practices.  Examples of species-specific EE are in the table below.
