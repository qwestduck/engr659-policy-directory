Department Chair Salary Conversion 
 

In most cases department chairs are provided salary increases for assuming chair positions. The 

amount is reduced if the department chair gives up the position. In cases when a faculty member 

on a 9-month contract becomes a department chair with a 12-month contract, the 9-month salary 

is converted by the application of a plus two-ninths formula, with the administrative supplement 

added after the conversion. The reverse procedure takes place if the faculty member gives up the 

chair position and returns to a 9-month contract.
