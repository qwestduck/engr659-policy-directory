Education in Human Research Protection 
 

Summary/Purpose: Mandatory educational requirement for all individuals involved in human 
subject research. 
 
Education is a key component of UM’s human research protection program.  Education includes 
the knowledge of federal, state, and local laws and regulations, relevant professional standards, 
and the policies and procedures of The University of Mississippi regarding the protection of 
research participants and the conduct of research.  IRB applications will be accepted only when 
all project staff have completed an education requirement. 
 
UM utilizes an online educational program sponsored by the Collaborative IRB Training 
Initiative (CITI) and hosted by the University of Miami.  Investigators, research staff, 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) members, and IRB staff are required to complete the 
appropriate CITI course for their group and subject population.  CITI certification is good for 
three years. A refresher course must be completed on or before one’s three-year anniversary date. 
 
Alternatives to comprehensive CITI training, including exemption from training, may be allowed 
for some studies, depending on risk. See policy RSP.RI.301.015, Exempt Human Research.  
Education of research collaborators at other research institutions will be evaluated on a case by 
case basis for comparable training. 
 
When applicable, individuals may be required to complete other appropriate training, such as 
Radiation Safety, Biological Safety, Chemical Safety, and/or other training offered by the Office 
of Health and Safety.  Specific training requirements may be obtained from that office.
