BICYCLES 

 

Summary/Purpose: This policy explains the proper procedures for storing bicycles during 

the academic year, including break periods.  

 

It is important for students to understand that the University does not permit bicycles to be stored 

in the hallways or stairwells. Bicycle racks are provided outside most residence halls. It is 

essential that students provide an adequate lock to secure their bicycles when parked outside. It is 

suggested that a U-bolt style lock be used. The proper use of this lock would include locking 

your bicycle to a bicycle rack. Additionally, the University Police Department (UPD) has 

engravers available for student use. Bicycles parked improperly are subject to fines and/or 

removal by the UPD. Bikes left on racks at the end of the academic year will be considered 

abandoned and will be removed prior to the beginning of the next academic year. Students may 

store their bicycles during fall, winter, and spring breaks in their residence hall room with their 

roommateâ€™s permission. At no time are bicycles to be stored in stairwells, hallways or restrooms.  

 

Northgate apartment residents must keep bicycles in a bicycle rack or inside the apartments and 

not in front of apartments (due to fire ordinance) or along the inside 

walkways/hallways/breezeways. Any bicycle left on the sidewalk or grass may be confiscated.
