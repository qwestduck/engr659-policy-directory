OBJECTIVITY IN RESEARCH 
 

I. Purpose 
 
The primary goal of this policy is to promote objectivity in research by establishing standards that provide a reasonable 
expectation that the design, conduct, and reporting of research funded under grants, cooperative agreements and 
contracts will be free from bias resulting from Investigator’s Financial Conflicts of Interest.  This policy is designed to 
protect the credibility and integrity of the University of Mississippi’s (UM) faculty, staff, and students so that public trust 
and confidence in sponsored research and educational activities is ensured. 
 
UM faculty, staff and students are committed to the principle of free, open, and objective inquiry in the conduct of 
research. Multifaceted relationships between Investigators and industry exist and often complement Research. 
However, these relationships make conflicts of interest inevitable.   
 
 UM has a responsibility to manage any actual or potential conflict of interest arising from a financial interest of an 
Investigator. The University requires that Investigators disclose significant financial interests that may present an actual 
conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest in relationship with a sponsored project and then manage 
or eliminate those conflicts. Disclosure is instrumental for protecting the reputation of Investigators and the integrity of 
their research against challenges of potential bias. 
 
In order to minimize the administrative burden to Investigators while meeting all regulations and state laws, this policy 
has separate procedures for PHS applications and awards (which require considerable effort) and for Non-PHS 
applications and awards (which require less effort). However, there is some overlap: PHS Investigators must complete 
Non-PHS self-screening questions and separate disclosures of relevant Significant Financial Interests as well as the 
extensive PHS form. 

II. Definitions1  
 

A. Confidentiality means that disclosed financial interests marked “Confidential” shall be kept in a 
locked cabinet accessible only to the Director of Research Integrity and Compliance and /or as 
encrypted files on a password protected computer. To the extent permitted by law, all records 
of financial interest submitted by an Investigator shall be made available only to the Conflict of 
Interest Committee and to others on a “need to know” basis with clear understanding of the 
confidentiality of the information. Records will be destroyed once the record retention period 
expires (See Section VII.).   
 

B. Conflict of Interest Committee (COIC) means the committee appointed by the Institutional 
Official to 1) review Significant Financial Interests Requiring Disclosure forms when a potential 
or actual conflict has been identified by the Investigator, the Director of Research Integrity and 
Compliance, and/or the Director of Technology Management, 2) determine if an actual or a 
potential conflict of interest exists, 3) suggest ways to manage, reduce or eliminate conflicts, 
and approve a Memorandum of Understanding (Conflict of Interest Management Plan) on 
behalf of the Institutional Official. The Committee will be comprised of the Director of Research 
Integrity and Compliance, the Director of Technology Management, one or two members of 
the University Research Board, the Investigator’s Dean or Dean’s designee – or the 



Investigator’s division head or designee for non-academic units, and other members as deemed 
appropriate by the Institutional Official. 

 
C. Equity Interest means stocks, stock options, or other ownership interests, as determined 

through reference to public prices or other reasonable measures of fair market value. 
 

D. Financial Conflict of Interest means any Significant Financial Interests Requiring Disclosure that may significantly 
affect the design, conduct or reporting of Research. 

 
E. Institutional Official means the person appointed by University of Mississippi, or his/her designee(s), to solicit 

and review statements from Investigators of Significant Financial Interests Requiring Disclosure. [See Section 42 
CFR 50.604(b) and 45 CFR Section 94.4(b)]. University of Mississippi has appointed the Vice Chancellor for 
Research and Sponsored Programs as its Institutional Official. 

 
F. Institutional Responsibilities means activities related to Investigators’ research, teaching, clinical, or 

administrative duties at University of Mississippi. 
 

G. Investigator means faculty, staff or students serving as Project Directors, Principal Investigators, and members 
of the research team identified as senior/key personnel on a grant or contract application, progress report, or 
any other report who are responsible for and have substantial independent decision making in respect to the 
design, conduct or reporting of the research, such as Collaborators or Consultants named on a grant. 
 

H. Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) means the document developed by the Conflict of Interest Committee 
(COIC), the Investigator and the Investigator’s Dean or Dean’s designee – or the Investigator’s division head or 
designee for non-academic units that constitutes the Conflict of Interest Management Plan for the resolution of 
an identified potential or actual conflict of interest and which includes, at a minimum, these mandatory key 
elements: 

1. The role and principal duties of the conflicted Investigator in the research project; 
2. Conditions of the management plan; 
3. How the management plan is designed to safeguard objectivity in the research project; 
4. Confirmation of the Investigator’s agreement to the management plan; 
5. How the management plan will be monitored to ensure Investigator compliance; and 
6. Other information as needed

B. MURA Exception to State of Mississippi Conflict of Interest laws 

 
The Mississippi Legislature created MURA in 1992 (MISSISSIPPI CODE: SEC. 37-147-1 to 37-147-15) to facilitate 
economic development and promote the public welfare and prosperity of the people of Mississippi within the 
state by encouraging the development of cooperative ventures among the state’s educational institutions, 
government and business. The MURA Act provides that “notwithstanding any other provision of state law” [the 
Ethics in Government Act], an employee of a university may apply to MURA for permission to establish and 
maintain a material financial interest in a private entity which provides or receives equipment, material, supplies 
or services in connection with the university in order to facilitate the transfer of technology developed by the 
employee from the university to commercial and industrial enterprises for economic development.  
 
Investigators interested in applying for MURA approval should meet with the Director of Technology 
Management to initiate technology licensing discussions and obtain assistance in completing the necessary 
documentation.  Prior to making application to MURA, UM Investigators must first receive approval in writing 
from their line management and the Chancellor. Permission may be granted by the Chancellor only if all of the 
following conditions are met: 
 
The Investigator  

1. Provided a detailed description of interest in private entity to the Chancellor 
2. Fully described the nature of the undertaking to the Chancellor 
3. Demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Chancellor that the proposed undertaking may benefit the 

economy of the state 
4. Demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Chancellor that the proposed undertaking will not adversely 

affect research public service or instructional activities at the university; and 
5. The employee’s interest in the private entity, or benefit from the interest, will not adversely affect any 

substantial state interest 
 

After approval is given by UM, the application is submitted to MURA for review by the Institutional Official.  
MURA may authorize an employee to maintain a material financial interest in a private entity if it considers the 
same information and factors submitted to UM, makes positive findings on all conditions, and reflects this fact in 
its minutes.   The Chancellor is required to submit an annual report to MURA detailing the status of each MURA 
approved project. 

IV. Applicability 
 

A. Applicability for PHS Grant and Contract Applications and Awards, PHS Excluded Awards, and Initiation of 
Policy 
 

1. This policy does not apply to research funded solely by PHS SBIR/STTR Program Phase I awards 
subsequent to August 24, 2012. However, human subjects research funded by PHS SBIR/STTR Programs 
are subject to this policy. 

2. The procedures for PHS Investigators (42 CFR Part 50 Subpart F) apply to PHS funded grants or 
cooperative agreements with an issue date of the Notice of Award that is subsequent to August 24, 
2012 and to solicitations issued and contracts awarded subsequent to August 24, 2012. 

 
 
 

http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-08-25/pdf/2011-21633.pdf�


 
B. PHS Subrecipient Requirements: 

 
For Research sponsored by the Public Health Service that involves subcontractors, subgrantees or subawardees 
(collectively “Subrecipients”) at other Institutions, UM requires a written agreement from Subrecipients that 
establishes whether UM’s policy or the subrecipient’s policy shall apply to the subrecipient’s Investigators. In all 
cases, UM must report to the PHS funding agency any Subrecipient Financial Conflicts of Interest prior to the 
execution of the subcontract or within 60 days of identification of a new Financial Conflict of Interest by the 
Subrecipient or UM that arises during the term of the subcontract. 
 

1. If the subrecipient’s policy is used, the subrecipient must certify that its financial conflict of interest 
policy is compliant with 42 CFR Part 50 and 45 CFR Part 94 and will be responsible for ensuring that the 
Subrecipient Institution and its Investigators comply with the federal regulations. Subrecipients must 
report to UM as the awardee Institution, any identified Financial Conflict of Interest within 10 business 
days of the management plan agreement with the Subrecipient’s Investigator, but no later than 45 days 
after identification of the Financial Conflict of Interest by the Subrecipient. The details of the Financial 
Conflict of Interest will be reported to the funding agency as required under applicable regulations or 
policies. 

2. If UM’s policy is used, the Subrecipient must ensure that all of its Investigators submit the PHS 
Significant Financial Interest Disclosure Form to UM prior to the time of application by UM (or at the 
time the Subrecipient signs an institutional letter of support if during an on-going award grant or 
contract). 

V. Procedures 
 
UM will manage, minimize, or eliminate Investigators’ Financial Conflicts of Interest to ensure that research will be free 
from potential bias resulting from Investigator financial interests. All Investigators pursuing sponsored research projects 
are required to report all financial interests that could affect or be affected by Research on which they are working or 
proposing to work on to the Office of Research and Sponsored Program’s (ORSP) Director of Research Integrity and 
Compliance. Investigators who are applying to or are funded by a PHS agency must follow a separate disclosure process 
for Significant Financial Interests related to their Institutional Responsibilities that is described in section V.A.   The 
Director of Research Integrity and Compliance will review the Investigator Significant Financial Interests Requiring 
Disclosure form and coordinate development of an appropriate management plan when a Financial Conflict of Interest 
exists. In developing these plans, UM aims to meet the following goals: 
 

• Safeguard the integrity of Research 
• Ensure that Research is objective and without bias in the design, conduct or reporting of it 
• Address unique circumstances and conditions that may be presented by individual cases 

 
A. Investigator Reporting Requirements 

 
All Investigators must provide Significant Financial Interests Requiring Disclosure to the Director of Research 
Integrity and Compliance in a sealed envelope marked ‘Confidential’ at the following time points: 

 
1. Prior to submission of a proposal 
2. Within thirty (30) days after a new Significant Financial Interest Requiring Disclosure is received or 

acquired (e.g. through purchase, marriage, or inheritance) 
3. Annually at the time of Progress Report submission 



 
Significant Financial Interest Disclosure Forms are available on the ORSP Objectivity in Research web page 
 

1. Non-PHS Investigators must complete 
 

a. the ‘General Significant Financial Interest Disclosure Form’   
 

2. PHS Investigators must complete BOTH 
 

a. the ‘PHS Significant Financial Interest Disclosure Form’ 
 
AND 
 

b. the ‘General Significant Financial Interest Disclosure Form’  
 

Note: One meets requirements for PHS regulations and the other for Mississippi State Law 
 
Investigators who need assistance deciding what interests apply and their categorization should contact the 
ORSP Office of Research Integrity and Compliance for guidance. 
 

B. Conflict of Interest Review Procedures 
 
1. Initial Review 

The Director of Research Integrity and Compliance will conduct a preliminary review of all Significant 
Financial Interest Disclosures 1) to determine if Investigators’ disclosure information is sufficiently 
complete for review or whether the Investor must be contacted for additional information or 
clarification and 2) to make an initial assessment in consult with the Director of Technology 
Management whether there is definitely no conflict of interest that could directly and significantly 
affect the design, conduct, or reporting of the Research (both Directors must concur here) or 
whether there is a possible or clear conflict of interest that could affect the Research. 
 

2. Conflict of Interest Committee (COIC) Functions and Review 
 

        The COIC will: 
 

a. Review any reports made regarding Significant Financial Interests  
b. Request and review any additional materials needed to evaluate the relationship of the 

Significant Financial Interests to the Research 
c. Determine whether the Significant Financial Interests require a plan to manage, reduce, or 

eliminate the financial interest and to develop such a plan 
d. Determine, for PHS funded activities, whether a Significant Financial Interest is related to a 

particular research project  and whether such interest is a Financial Conflict of Interest 
pursuant to 42 CFR Part 50/45 CFR Part 94 

e. Consult with the Investigator to get clarification on Significant Financial Interests 
f. May suggest ways to manage, reduce, or eliminate the conflict   
g. Review a Conflict of Interest Management Plan that the Investigator, in collaboration with 

the  COIC member representing the Investigator’s Dean or Dean’s designee – or the 
Investigator’s division head or designee for non-academic units, develops that details 



proposed steps to manage, reduce, or eliminate any actual or potential conflict of interest 
presented by  Significant Financial Interests 

h. Approve the proposed Conflict of Interest Management Plan or add further management 
measures before approval, as the COIC deems necessary, communicate added measures to 
the  Investigator, and take into consideration the Investigator’s comments.  

  
        Examples of such measures include: 

o Public disclosure of financial conflicts of interests (e.g., when presenting or publishing the 
research; to staff members working on the project; to the Institutional Review Board) 

o For research projects involving human subjects research, disclosure of financial conflicts of 
interest directly to participants 

o Appointment of an independent monitor capable of taking measures to protect the design, 
conduct, and reporting of the research against bias resulting from the Financial Conflict of 
Interest 

o Modification of the research plan 
o Change of personnel or personnel responsibilities, or disqualifications of personnel from 

participation in all or a portion of the research 
o Reduction or elimination of the financial interest (e.g., sale of an equity interest) 
o Severance of relationships that create financial conflicts 

1. If the COIC determines that there is no conflict of interest that could directly and significantly affect the 
design, conduct, or reporting of the Research, the documentation of the review and determination will 
be filed along with the Disclosure Forms and retained as per the recordkeeping retention requirement. 
(Section VII.) 

 
2. If the COIC determines that there is a Financial Conflict of Interest and a Conflict of Interest 

Management Plan is developed, it shall be incorporated into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
that details the conditions or restrictions imposed upon the Investigator in the conduct of the project or 
in the relationship with the sponsoring entity. The MOU shall be signed by the Investigator, the 
Investigator’s Dean or Dean’s designee – or the Investigator’s division head or designee for non-
academic units, and the Institutional Official. 

 
3. Notification of Conflict of Interest Committee’s Decision and Recommended Approval of Plan:  The Institutional 

Official will be informed by the COIC when it 1) determines that an Investigator’s Significant Financial 
Interest Requiring Disclosure must be managed, reduced, or eliminated and 2) when an MOU containing 
the management plan has been approved by all signing parties.  The Institutional Official will sign the 
proposed plan or notify the COIC within seven (7) days with an objection to the plan.  In the latter case, 
the Institutional Official, Investigator, and COIC will work towards developing a mutually agreeable plan. 
If agreement on a plan cannot be reached within fourteen (14) days after receipt of an objection from 
the Institutional Official, then the recommendations of all parties shall be presented for a final decision 
to the Provost, which decision shall be provided within 10 days of receipt of the recommendations. 

 
4. Investigator Notification and Appeals:  The Director of Research Integrity and Compliance will notify 

Investigators when a Significant Financial Interest Requiring Disclosure must be managed and when a 
Financial Conflict of Interest exists. The final recommended plan for the management, reduction, or 
elimination of the Significant Financial Interest Requiring Disclosure in the form of an MOU will be sent 
to the Investigator for signature. Investigators can appeal the plan with justifications in writing to the 
COIC within 10 business days of receipt of the notification. Should the Investigator not file a written 



appeal with the COIC by such time, then the Investigator shall be considered to have waived his/her 
right to appeal and the MOU will be final, except for noting refusal of the Investigator to sign the MOU 
where valid. If the Investigator’s appeal is denied by the COIC, the Investigator can appeal to the Provost 
within 10 business days of receipt of the notification from the COIC. The Provost will notify the 
Investigator within 10 business days as to whether the appeal is granted or denied. During any appeal to 
the COIC or Provost, Investigators must not expend any funds under any award from a sponsor for the 
conduct of the Research at issue and either (a) agree to abide by the initial recommendations of the 
COIC or (b) remove themselves from any participation in the Research. 
 

5. Research with Human Subjects:  Special precautions must be taken to avoid bias with respect to Research 
involving Human Subjects involving the evaluation of strategies or products that may affect or be 
affected by the financial interests of UM or UM Investigators. A UM Investigator shall not ordinarily 
participate in any Research involving human subjects that encompasses evaluation of such a strategy or 
product if he/she has a Significant Financial Interest that could directly and significantly affect the 
design, conduct or reporting of the Research unless the Investigator presents a compelling justification 
for a waiver of this policy based on unique qualifications as an Investigator. The degree of risk to human 
subjects and the justification will be reviewed by the Committee. If compelling circumstances justify a 
waiver of this policy, the Research will be subject to stringent management measures to ensure the 
safety of the human participants and the integrity of the Research. The IRB must review and approve 
any management plan for human subject Research. The IRB may require additional safeguards to 
protect  human subject participants.  In accordance with 42 CFR Section 50.606(c), in any case in which 
the Department of Health and Human Services determines that a Public Health Service-funded project 
of clinical Research, whose purpose is to evaluate the safety or effectiveness of a drug, medical device or 
treatment has been designed, conducted or reported by an Investigator with a conflicting interest that 
was not reported or managed as required by this Policy or the applicable regulations, then UM shall, at 
minimum, require the Investigator involved to disclose the conflicting interest in each public 
presentation of the results of the Research and to request an addendum to previously published 
presentations.  An Investigator who has failed to report a Significant Financial Interest Requiring 
Disclosure related to clinical Research will be subject to sanctions described in Section VI. If the project is 
funded by a PHS agency, the Investigator will also be subject to the mandatory Retrospective Review 
procedures described in Section VI. 

 
C. Reporting and Expenditure of Funds 

 
No expenditure of sponsor funding for Research shall occur with respect to any Research project for 
which the Committee has determined that a management plan is required unless and until all reporting 
requirements have been met. For any Significant Financial Interest Requiring Disclosure that is identified 
after the funding for the Research is awarded, the COIC will determine whether a Financial Conflict of 
Interest exists and whether a management plan is required (or whether an existing plan must be 
amended). As required by the sponsor’s regulations or policies, ORSP shall report to the funding agency 
any management plans or Financial Conflict of Interest within 60 days of the interest’s identification. 
The outcome of Conflict of Interest Committee reviews will be communicated to the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) for all Research involving human subjects and to the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee (IACUC) for all Research involving animal subjects. The IRB may require additional measures 
to protect the safety and welfare of Research subjects under their purview. 

 
D. PHS Awards 

  
Procedures and requirements for reporting and training for PHS Awards 



 
1. Reports to PHS Funding Agency 

 
As required by federal regulations, ORSP shall report the following information regarding Financial 
Conflicts of Interest to the funding agency through the eRA Commons: 

 
a. Project Number 
b. PD/PI or Contact PD/PI if multiple PD/PI model is used 
c. Name of the Investigator with the Financial Conflict of Interest 
d. Name of the entity with which the Investigator has a Financial Conflict of Interest 
e. Nature of the Significant Financial Interest (e.g. equity, consulting fee, travel reimbursement, 

honorarium) 
f. Value of the Significant Financial Interest, or a statement that the interest is one whose valued 

cannot be readily determined through reference to public prices or other reasonable measure of 
fair market value 

g. A description of how the Significant Financial Interest relates to the PHS-funded research and 
the basis for the COIC’s determination that the Significant Financial Interest conflicts with such 
research 

h. A description of key elements of the Conflict of Interest Management Plan including: 
• Role and principal duties of the conflicted Investigator in the research project 
• Conditions of the management plan 
• How the management plan is designed to safeguard objectivity in the research project 
• Confirmation of the Investigator’s agreement to the management plan 
• How the management plan will be monitored to ensure Investigator compliance 
• Other information as needed or requested by the funding agency 

 
Additionally, each award year ORSP must provide the funding agency an annual FCOI report that 
addresses the status of the Financial Conflict of Interest and any changes to the management plan for 
the duration of the project period (including extensions with or without funding). The annual FCOI 
Report shall specify whether the financial conflict is still being managed or explain why the Financial 
Conflict of Interest no longer exists. ORSP must report to the agency the annual FCOI report at the time 
of the progress report. 

 
2. Reports in Response to Public Requests for Information 

 
As required by federal regulations and upon written request, UM shall provide written information to 
any requestor. Requests must be in writing and must identify the specific PHS project number. The 
request must include a named recipient and return address with a physical street address (P.O. Boxes 
are not acceptable). The written response will state that the information is current as of the date of the 
correspondence. It will also state that the information is subject to updates at least annually and within 
60 days of the identification of a new conflict of interest, and that this updated information must be 
requested under separate cover. The following information will be provided to requestors: 

 
a. Project Number 
b. Name of the Investigator with a conflicted interest 
c. Investigator’s title and role with respect to the research project 
d. Nature of the financial interest (e.g. equity, consulting fee, travel reimbursement, honorarium) 



e. Value of the financial interest (in ranges), or a statement that the interest is one whose valued 
cannot be readily determined through reference to public prices or other reasonable measure of 
fair market value 

 
3.  Mandatory PHS Investigator Training 

 
Each PHS Investigator must complete conflict of interest ethics training prior to engaging in Research, at 
least every four years thereafter, and immediately under these circumstances: 
 

 a. When this policy changes in a manner that affects Investigator requirements 
b. When an Investigator is not in compliance with this policy or a management plan 

VI. Compliance with this Policy 
 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all disclosures required by this Policy are made with accuracy and within 
time limits. The Investigator must also follow prescribed plans for the management, reduction, or elimination of an 
identified Financial Conflict of Interest. Failure to comply is a violation of this University Policy. The Investigator’s Dean 
or Dean’s designee – or the Investigator’s division head or designee for non-academic units, or the Conflict of Interest 
Review Committee may inspect any necessary records to ensure compliance with the plan. 

 
The COIC, in consultation with the Institutional Official, is responsible for investigating and resolving any alleged 
violations of this Policy and may recommend appropriate actions to the Institutional Official to enforce this Policy and/or 
to impose a sanction for noncompliance. The Institutional Official shall review and take appropriate action to implement 
such recommendations as deemed appropriate. Sanctions for noncompliance may include reprimands or other 
measures, up to and including termination of employment. In investigating any violation of this Policy, the COIC must 
determine if any violation of this Policy has biased the design, conduct or reporting of the Research.  The COIC will take 
appropriate steps to maintain the objectivity of the Research and other corrective actions as deemed appropriate. The 
COIC shall promptly notify the Institutional Official of any conflicts not resolved to the satisfaction of the COIC, along 
with recommended actions. The COIC will promptly notify the Research sponsor and affected UM units of any violations 
and/or corrective actions, as described above. 

 
If a violation is associated with a collateral proceeding under the Responding to Allegations of Research Misconduct 
policy, then recommendations on sanctions will be deferred until the research misconduct process is completed. 
 
 
PHS Procedures for failure to comply with this policy or a Conflict of Interest Management Plan (MOU): Procedures 
for Mandatory Retrospective Review  

 
In addition the above review and sanctions, UM and PHS Investigators are subject to the following procedures when a 
Financial Conflict of Interest is not identified or managed in a timely manner including failure by the Investigator to 
disclose a Significant Financial Interest Requiring Disclosure that is determined by the COIC to constitute a Financial 
Conflict of Interest; failure by UM to review or manage such a Financial Conflict of Interest; or failure by the Investigator 
to comply with a Conflict of Interest Management Plan. 
 

A. UM must implement, on at least an interim basis, a management plan that shall specify the actions that have 
been, and will be, taken to manage such Financial Conflict of Interest going forward; 
 



B. Within 120 days of the COIC’s determination of noncompliance, it must complete a retrospective review of the 
Investigator’s activities and the PHS funded research project to determine whether any PHS -funded research, or 
portion thereof, conducted during the time period of the noncompliance, was biased in the design, conduct, or 
reporting of such research. 
 

C. The COIC must document the retrospective review and include, at minimum, the following information: 
1. Project number 
2. Project title 
3. PD/PI or contact PD/PI if a multiple PD/PI model is used 
4. Name of the Investigator with the FCOI 
5. Name of the entity with which the Investigator has a Financial Conflict of Interest 
6. Reason(s) for the retrospective review 
7. Detailed methodology used for the retrospective review (e.g., methodology of the review process, 

composition of the review panel, documents reviewed) 
8. Findings of the review 
9. Conclusions of the review 

 
D. Based on the results of the retrospective review, if appropriate, ORSP shall update the previously submitted  
 FCOI report, specifying the actions that will be taken to manage the Financial Conflict of Interest going forward. 

 
If the retrospective review team members find bias, ORSP must notify the PHS agency promptly and submit a 
mitigation report to agency. The mitigation report must include, at a minimum, the key elements documented in 
the retrospective review above and a description of the impact of the bias on the research project and UM’s 
plan of action or actions taken to eliminate or mitigate the effect of the bias (e.g., impact on the research 
project; extent of harm done, including any qualitative and quantitative data to support any actual or future 
harm; analysis of whether the research project is salvageable). Thereafter, UM will submit annual FCOI reports 
to the PHS agency. Depending on the nature of the Financial Conflict of Interest, UM may determine that 
additional interim measures are necessary with regard to the Investigator’s participation in the PHS funded 
research project between the date that the Financial Conflict of Interest or the Investigator’s noncompliance is 
determined and the completion of UM’s retrospective review. 

 
 

VII. Records Maintenance 
   

The Director of Research Integrity and Compliance is responsible for maintaining records, identifiable to each 
project, all transactional reports of Significant Financial Interests, and all actions taken by the COIC or other 
appropriate units within UM to manage any actual or potential Financial Conflict of Interest for the longer of at 
least three (3) years from: (a) the date of submission of the final expenditures report, for federally funded 
grants; (b) from the date of termination or completion of the award; or (c) from the date of the resolution of any 
action by any governmental agency involving the records; or (d) as applicable, from any other date specified in 
45 CFR Section 74.53(b) for different situations, as appropriate.
