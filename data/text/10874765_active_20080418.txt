Full Recovery of Facilities and Administrative Costs Required for All Sponsored Programs 
 

Summary/Purpose:  All requests to external sponsors for funding to support research and 
scholarly or creative activities must include full recovery of Facilities and Administrative Costs, 
unless explicitly limited or prohibited by the sponsor. 
 
Facilities and Administrative (F&A) Costs (also called indirect costs or overhead) are costs that 
cannot be uniquely associated with a particular project but which are nonetheless incurred by the 
University when sponsored projects are undertaken.  They include costs such as departmental 
accounting and clerical support, network support, equipment depreciation, building and facilities 
operation and maintenance expenses, library expenses, and institutional sponsored programs 
administration.  These costs are budgeted and charged as a percentage of some specified portion 
of the direct cost elements. 
 
Budgets of proposals for external funding must include full F&A costs according to the 
University’s federally negotiated rates, unless limited or prohibited by the sponsor to which the 
proposal is directed.  Exceptions to this may be allowed under special circumstances but only 
with the prior approval of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Sponsored Programs (see 
below). 
 
If the sponsor limits or prohibits F&A costs, the Principal Investigator/Project Director (PI/PD) 
must enter the required explanation on the UM Transmittal Sheet for the proposal and also attach 
documentation of the sponsor’s policy (such as program guidelines or website reference) when 
submitting the proposal for Office of Research and Sponsored Programs (ORSP) review. 
 
If a sponsor allows F&A costs but the PI/PD wants to request a waiver of these costs, such a 
waiver must be requested, in writing, from the Vice Chancellor for Research and Sponsored 
Programs at least two weeks in advance of proposal submission.  Such requests are reviewed on 
a case-by-case basis and are approved only under special circumstances.
