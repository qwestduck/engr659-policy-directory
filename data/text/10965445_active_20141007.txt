I.D. CARDS 

 

Purpose/Summary: This policy defines the expectations for appropriate use of students' 

Ole Miss identification cards. Student Housing staff will routinely ask students to show 

their I.D. cards in an effort to maintain security within the residence halls.  

 

Identity of residence hall students is easily established by means of an Ole Miss I.D. card with an 

appropriate residence hall sticker attached. For security reasons, the CDA, CA, or other student 

housing staff member will routinely ask residents entering the building to show their I.D. card.  

Ole Miss I.D. cards are not transferable. A student may not lend their I.D. to another student for 

any purpose including, but not limited to: entry to a building; misrepresentation of age; the 

purchase of meals, vending items, or other goods which may be charged to the Ole Miss I.D. 

card. False I.D. cards will be confiscated and turned over to the University Police.
