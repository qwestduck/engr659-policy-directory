Counteroffers Policy 
 

The University may see the need to make a counteroffer to retain its best faculty and staff. 

Counteroffers are made on a case-by-case basis, given that the decision to make a counteroffer is based 

on many department-specific, school/college-specific, institution-specific, individual-specific, and 

discipline-specific factors. Counteroffers are subject to the availability of resources. When a department 

chair or unit director determines a need for a counteroffer, he/she should consult with the Dean/Vice 

Chancellor as to whether a counteroffer should be made. If the department chair/unit director and 

Dean/Vice Chancellor determine a counteroffer is warranted, the Dean/Vice Chancellor will request 

Provost approval for the counteroffer. The Dean/Vice Chancellor should provide justification for the 

counteroffer, as well as evidence of a job offer from another employer. The Provost, in consultation with 

the Dean/Vice Chancellor and considering the availability of funds, will decide to approve the 

counteroffer or not.
