Part 3.2 Return of Federal Funds Overview 

 

Federal Title IV funds (Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, SEOG, TEACH, 

Work-Study, Direct Loans, Perkins Loan, and PLUS loans) are awarded under the 

assumption that the student will attend school for the entire period of enrollment.  When 

students withdraw, they may no longer be eligible for the full amount of Title IV funds 

that they were originally scheduled to receive.  Then the amount of Title IV grant or loan 

assistance “earned” by the student must be determined.   

 If the amount disbursed to the student is greater than the amount the student 
earned, the unearned funds must be returned.   

 If the amount disbursed to the student is less than the amount the student earned, 
and for which the student is otherwise eligible, he or she qualifies for a post-

withdrawal disbursement of the earned aid that was not received. 

In addition to Federal Title IV funds, Federal Tuition Assistance (provided by the 

military to eligible members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard) is 

also awarded under the assumption that the student will attend school for the entire period 

of enrollment.  When a student withdraws (for reasons other than military orders) from 

school, they may no longer be eligible to receive the full amount originally awarded.  

FTA funds are earned proportionally during an enrollment period, with unearned funds 

returned based upon when a student stops attending.   

  

 

 

Part 3.2.1.a Determine the Date of Withdrawal 

 

The date of a student’s withdrawal is (A) the date in which the student began the official 

withdrawal process, or (B) the date in which UM determined that the student ceased to 

attend class. 

 

If a student begins attendance but withdraws before being awarded federal funds, the 

student is not considered to have been a federal aid recipient and the requirements to 

return funds do not apply.  For more information, see policy “3.7 Withdrawals” 

 

The OFA generates a term-based report that identifies all students who received federal 

aid and officially withdrew within the term.  To determine unofficial withdrawals, this 

same report will be used after each term’s grades have posted to determine which 

students posted all “F’, “W”, and/or “I” grades.  The OFA may assume that the mid-point 

of the term was the last date of attendance for an unofficial withdrawal.  However, the 

student is allowed the opportunity to document attendance past the midpoint.  

 

 

 

 



Part 3.2.1.b Academic Calendar 

 

Federal aid return calculations are based on UM’s official Academic Calendar.  This 

calendar is available at http://registrar.olemiss.edu/academic-calendar-menu/ 

 

When counting the number of days in a period of enrollment, weekends are included for 

purposes of the calculation.  Breaks of five or more consecutive days, however, are not 

included. 

 

Part 3.2.2. Calculate the Amount of Federal Tuition Assistance Earned/Unearned 

 

The return of FTA funds is determined by calculating the earned and unearned portions 

of the aid as of the date the student ceased attendance at the University. 

 

The equation for calculating a student’s earned and unearned portions is called the 

“Return Calculation”, and it is as follows: 

 

Number of Calendar Days Completed in the Term as of Date of Withdrawal (divided by) 

Total Number of Calendar Days in Term 

 

If the resulting percentage is greater than 60 percent, no paybacks will be processed. If 

the result is 60 percent or less, then this percentage is used to determine how much of the 

FTA that was disbursed (or could have been disbursed) is considered earned. The 

remainder must be returned to the military. 

 

Part 3.2.3.a Calculate the Amount of Title IV Aid Earned/Unearned 

 

The return of Title IV Funds is determined by calculating the earned and unearned 

portions of Title IV aid as of the date the student ceased attendance at the University. 

 

The equation for calculating a student’s earned and unearned portions is called the 

“Return Calculation”, and it is as follows: 

 

Number of Calendar Days Completed in the Term as of Date of Withdrawal (divided by) 

Total Number of Calendar Days in Term 

 

If the resulting percentage is greater than 60 percent, no paybacks will be processed. If 

the result is 60 percent or less, then this percentage is used to determine how much of the 

aid that was disbursed (or could have been disbursed) is considered earned. The 

remainder must be returned to the Title IV program(s). 

 

UM must return the lesser of (A) the amount of SFA not earned or (B) the institutional 

costs (see below) that the student incurred multiplied by the percentage of SFA not 

earned.  

 

http://registrar.olemiss.edu/academic-calendar-menu/


Part 3.2.3.b Institutional Costs 

 

Included in the list of institutional costs are: 

 Tuition 

 On-Campus Housing 

 Non-Resident Fee 

 Flex/Meal Plan Charges 

 Capital Improvements Fee  

 Course Fees (online program fees and lab fees) 
 

Any items that are not included in the list above are not considered institutional costs. At 

UM, non-institutional costs may include but are not limited to:  

 Parking Permits 

 Registration Fees 

 Textbook Fees 

 Tickets to athletic events or concerts 
 

 

Part 3.2.3.c Allocation of Unearned Aid 

 

Unearned funds are first applied (paid back) to any Title IV loans borrowed during the 

term. As stipulated by federal regulations, funds are returned in the following order: 

 

(1) Unsubsidized Direct Loans 

(2) Subsidized Direct Loans 

(3) Federal Perkins Loans 

(4) Direct PLUS Loans (Parent and Graduate) 

(5) Federal Pell Grants 

(6) FSEOG  

(7) TEACH Grants 

(8) Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants 

 

When UM must return loan funds to DOE on the student’s behalf (or parent’s, in the case 

of a PLUS loan), the student’s bursar account will be charged for this amount.  When the 

federal calculation determines, instead, that it is the student’s (or parent’s) responsibility 

to return funds directly to the DOE, the earned Title IV loan funds are repaid in 

accordance with the terms of the loan. If unearned funds remain after all loans have been 

repaid, the remaining unearned funds must be credited to Title IV programs in the 

following order: 

 

(1) Federal Pell Grant 

(2) Federal SEOG 

(3) TEACH Grant 

 



When the school must return grant funds on the student’s behalf, the student’s bursar 

account will be charged for this amount. When the responsibility for repaying funds to 

the Title IV grant programs falls to the student, the student is required to return only 50 

percent of the grant repayment as calculated using the federal formula. Grant 

overpayments may be collected according to arrangements satisfactory to the school or 

by overpayment collection procedures prescribed by the Department of Education. 

 

Note: Federal Work Study is excluded from this policy. 

 

Part 3.2.3.d Notification of Return of Funds 

 

Students for which a portion of Title IV aid or Federal Tuition Assistance must be 

returned will receive an email from the OFA indicating that an adjustment has been made 

and funds have been returned on the student’s behalf.  This communication further 

instructs that any resulting balances on the student account must be paid by the student 

and arrangements for payment must be made directly with the Office of the Bursar. 

 

An electronic memo will be created and stored within the financial aid system to 

document each return of Title IV and FTA funds.  

 

Correspondence: 

 

Please note that all correspondence from the OFA will be carried out through email. 

Therefore, the student is responsible for checking his or her Ole Miss email account 

regularly. If the student does not use their Ole Miss account, it is recommended that he or 

she forward it to an active email account. 

 

 

Part 3.2.3.e Applicable Deadlines 

 

Two primary deadlines impact R2T4 calculations: 

1. The 45-day time frame for the return of funds.  The UM must return unearned 
funds as soon as possible but no later than 45 days from the determination of a 

student’s withdrawal.  Funds are considered returned in this time frame if the 

deposit or transfer into the school’s federal funds bank account have been 

awarded and disbursed to another eligible student or if the funds have been 

returned to the Department electronically using G5. 

2. The 30-day required notification of the need for authorization to make a post-
withdrawal disbursement of Title IV loan funds.  The UM will notify students, or 

parents for a Direct Parent PLUS loan, in writing of their eligibility for a post 

withdrawal disbursement if applicable.   



Part 3.2.3.f Post-Withdrawal Disbursement Notification 

 

The Return of Title IV Funds calculation may determine that a student is potentially 

eligible for a post-withdrawal disbursement if all aid was not disbursed prior to 

withdrawal.   

 

 Any grant funds are automatically applied to the balance.  

 If the student is eligible for post-withdrawal loans, a post-withdrawal 
disbursement notification letter will be sent to the student and/or parent (for 

parent PLUS loans) to determine award acceptance.  If the student/parent does not 

respond within 14 days, the offered loans will be removed from the award 

package.

Post-Withdrawal Disbursement Notification 
 

Because of your withdrawal from the University of Mississippi and Federal Title IV financial aid 

regulations, it has been determined you are eligible for a post-withdrawal disbursement.  You may accept 

all, a portion, or none of the loan amount(s) listed in the chart below.  This authorization must be completed 

before any loans can be applied to your Bursar account.   

 

The University of Mississippi is obligated to make this post-withdrawal disbursement only if you 

accept the funds 14 days after this form is sent.  If we have not heard from you by that date, we will 

cancel your loan amounts with the lender.  Please note any grant award(s) will automatically be applied to 

the remaining balance.
