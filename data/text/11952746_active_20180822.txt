University Student Organizational Conduct
DSA.SC.200.100

Summary/Purpose: To inform	  student organizations of their duty to honor university
policies.

When	  student	  organizations decide to affiliate with the University of Mississippi,	  they
accept the rights and responsibilities of membership in the community. Student
organizations	  pledge	  to	  uphold	  values	  identified	  in the	  university	  creed	  and encourage	  
others to follow their example.

When a student organization acts in a manner inconsistent with university	  policy, they
may be subject to University conduct charges and proceedings.
