Resident Check Out  
 

Summary/Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to explain the procedures students must use 
when moving out of student housing. 
 
Residents must schedule appointments with their Community Assistants (CAs) to check out of 
student housing. The appointment should be scheduled at least 24 hours prior to the desired 
checkout time. The CA and the resident will record any changes to the room on the Room 
Condition Report (RCR).  Charges may be added by student housing for any damages to the 
space. Failure to check out of student housing by following this procedure may result in a $25 
improper checkout fee.  
 
Items left in a space after the student is believed to have vacated will be considered abandoned 
property. The following procedure will be followed in the case of abandoned property: 

• Student housing will confirm that the space has been vacated. 
• Student housing will inventory the abandoned property, bag the property, and label it. 
• The property will be removed from the space and stored for a maximum of thirty (30) 

days. 
• The owner of the property will be charged a storage fee for the collection and storage of 

the property. 
• To retrieve the abandoned property, the student must contact the Area Coordinator of 

the community in which he or she lived.  
• If the property is not retrieved prior to the thirty (30) day deadline, the property will be 

disposed of.
