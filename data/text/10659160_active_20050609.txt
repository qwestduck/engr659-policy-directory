Inclement Weather/Natural Disaster Guidelines 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Information regarding the University closing due to inclement weather or 
natural disaster is given along with compensation rates of those employees who are required or 
choose to work during the closed period. 
 
 
When the University is closed due to inclement weather or natural disaster, most employees will 
receive Administrative Leave and will not be required to work. However, nonexempt emergency 
crew employees assigned to work by their respective department heads will receive premium pay 
at the rate of two and one-half times the regular rate (one and one-half times in addition to 
regular pay) for all hours worked during the declared period of inclement weather. This rate 
applies both to "regular" hours and to "overtime" hours. For example, an employee earning $6 
per hour would receive $15 for each hour of emergency work during the declared inclement 
weather period, regardless of the number of hours worked in the workweek involved.  
 
Employees who are allowed to work, but not assigned to work, by the respective department 
heads will receive compensatory time on an hour-for-hour basis.
