Lunch Breaks (Meal Periods) 
 

Summary/Purpose:  An employee’s work performance and individual health may benefit 

from taking a break.  Lunch breaks (meal periods) are provided to employees.  Breaks and 

lunch breaks are periods of time, specified by the manager, during which employees are not 

actively working on the job. Regulations for breaks (rest periods) and lunch break (meal 

periods) are given. 

 

Breaks (Rest Periods): 

Employees are encouraged to take breaks from work assignments.  Breaks generally lasts from 

5 – 20 minutes per four hours worked, to eat, visit the restroom, read, talk with friends, walk, 

and handle personal business.  The break may last up to 20 minutes and is arranged within the 

workday by the supervisor/manager.   The supervisor may also request that the break be taken 

away from the employee’s immediate work area/desk.  These breaks are a privilege and not a 

right and must not be abused. Employees are not required to use personal time or “time 

without pay” for these short, approved breaks.  Sufficient personnel should be on duty at all 

times to carry on the normal functions of the department. 

 

Lunch Breaks (Meal Periods): 

The lunch break is to typically remain one hour in length; however different lunch increments 

may be established at the discretion of the department head.  At least a ½ hour lunch break 

should be provided to and taken by an employee.  On occasion, an employee may have a need 

to “work through” lunch in order to meet a family need or personal obligation.  This is 

allowable; however it may not be practiced on a regular basis or as a set schedule.  Lunch 

breaks are not considered work time and are not compensable.
