Meal Plan Change Schedule 

Summary/Purpose:  Meal Plan Change Schedule 

 

Changes in a meal plan resulting in a lesser plan are allowed only through the end 

of the first three weeks of fall and spring semester, with charges prorated 

accordingly.  Changes must be submitted to the ID Center in writing or by meal 

plan change request form at olemissdining.com before the change deadline to 

be considered. This includes changes to a Greek plan in the spring. No late 

requests will be considered or exceptions made due to late acceptance into 

organization.  Once fees are assessed, the first change is done at no charge.  A 

change fee of $25 is assessed for additional changes.  Adjustments, for usage 

from the previous plan, will be made to the new plan, Flex, or Ole Miss Express, 

after the change is completed.  If meals or funds are not available for these 

adjustments, the Bursar account will be billed for previous plan usage, in addition 

to the new meal plan.
