Disorderly Conduct
 
DSA.SC.200.015
 

Summary/Purpose: To maintain a community of learning dedicated to nurturing excellence 
in intellectual inquiry by informing students of their duty to refrain from conduct that disrupts 
the university community. 

As voluntary members of the University, students will not engage in behavior that disrupts the 
academic, research or service mission or activities of the University, or disrupts any activity 
or event of the University community.  Some examples of behavior that are inconsistent with 
this responsibility include, but are not limited to, the following: conduct which causes a 
breach of the peace; lewd, obscene or indecent conduct; conduct which interferes with or 
disrupts activities or functions sponsored or participated in by the University or by members 
of the University community; interfering with or obstructing pedestrian or vehicular traffic; 
obstructing or interfering with ingress or egress of campus buildings or facilities; conduct 
which interferes with the rights of others; unauthorized use of electronic or other devices to 
take a phone or make an audio or video record of any person without his or her expressed or 
implied consent when such recording will demonstrate a lack of the respect for the dignity of 
another by being likely to cause injury or distress.  Students who act inconsistently with this 
value and policy will be subject to conduct charges and proceedings.
