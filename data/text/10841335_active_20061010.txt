MISREPRESENTING PERSONAL PURCHASES AS UNIVERSITY BUSINESS  
 

Summary / Purpose: Misrepresenting personal purchase(s) as a university purchase to 
gain an unfair advantage. 
 
University employees are prohibited from establishing personal charge accounts or from 
purchasing personal items from companies or individuals in the name of The University 
of Mississippi or any other university department.  Receiving quantity discounts, 
avoiding payment of sales taxes and / or shipping charges as well as extending personal 
debt beyond normal payment terms by representing the purchase(s) as a University 
authorized purchase constitutes a fraudulent act. 
 
Only duly authorized purchases using a university issued procurement card, purchase 
order or other approved / authorized payment form as specified by University Spending 
Policies are acceptable university expenditures.  All other charges are personal and will 
be owed by the employee regardless of the circumstances.  Items purchased outside 
approved channels for university use are still considered personal until reimbursement or 
payment is completed through one of the approved university payment venues.
