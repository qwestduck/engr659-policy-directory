Payments to Foreign Visitors and Non-U.S. Citizens 
 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Information covering payment to foreign visitors and non-U.S. citizens. 
 
 
Both federal immigration laws and tax laws place a number of restrictions, and in many cases 
prohibitions, on payments made to foreign visitors. Violation of these laws can result in serious 
consequences for both the foreign visitor and the University. The University cannot make any 
payments to, or reimburse any expenses for, a foreign visitor who is not properly authorized 
under federal immigration laws. 
 
Payments to foreign visitors are also subject to the general guidelines outlined in the Professional 
Services Section of the University Spending Policies.
