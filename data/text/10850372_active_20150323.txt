POLICY ON SELLING SURPLUS EQUIPMENT  
AND CONFLICT OF INTEREST CONSIDERATIONS  

 

Summary / Purpose: To avoid any possible Employee Conflict of Interest, or the appearance of a conflict 
surrounding the sale of surplus state property:  

 
The Office of the Mississippi State Department of Audit (State Auditor) has determined that it is a “Conflict 
of Interest” for any University of Mississippi employee to purchase items that are surplus to the University 
of Mississippi. 

MS Code # 25-4-105, (3), (b) reads " No public servant shall: Be a purchaser, 
directly or indirectly, at any sale made by him in his official capacity or by the 
government entity of which he is an officer or an employee, except in respect of 
the sale of goods or services when provided as public utilities or offered on a 
uniform price schedule." 

Employees of the university are prohibited from submitting sealed bids for the purchase of state surplus 
property when sold to the highest bidder by way of public "sealed envelope" bid sales conducted by 
Procurement Services.
