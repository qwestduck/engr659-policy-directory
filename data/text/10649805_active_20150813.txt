The University of Mississippi 

 

Game Day Activities 
 

Summary/Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to define the procedure for Game Day activities. 

 

Game Day activities are coordinated by the Chancellor’s Office, by committee, chaired by the 

Vice Chancellor for Administration and Finance.  

 

Use of the Grove and the Circle are restricted on game days to personal tailgating activities and 

official University of Mississippi activities. Tents that are not for official university activities and 

are erected within these spaces must be of a reasonable and appropriate size.  Determining 

whether a tent is of a reasonable or appropriate size is solely at the discretion of the University.  

In general, tents that are 12 x 20 or smaller (this includes 9 x 9, 10 x 10, and 12 x 12) are 

reasonable and appropriate.  If a tent is determined to be of an unacceptable size or is housing 

unacceptable activities, the owner or vendor will be asked to immediately reduce the size of the 

tent or remove it. 

 

Only official University organizations may reserve space in the Grove on football weekends. All 

reservations must follow established procedures and timelines. The remaining area of the Grove 

will be referred to as an “Open Area.” It cannot be reserved and will be available on a first-come 

basis. Unreserved space in the “reserved area” will be open to the public on Saturday. Tents that 

require stakes are NOT ALLOWED in the “Open Area” of the Grove.   

 

No cars will be allowed in the Grove for any reason.
