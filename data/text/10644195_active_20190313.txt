Registration Fee 
 

Summary/Purpose:  The University of Mississippi Bursar’s policy on applying registration fees 
to student accounts. 
 
 
The University’s registration process consists of three phases.  You may register for courses 
during any of the phases; however, a nonrefundable registration fee of $50 for Phase 2 
registration or $100 for Phase 3 registration will be assessed.  As an incentive for students who 
register early, the University will waive the registration fee for students who register during 
Phase 1.  The fee is also waived if you are a newly admitted student registering at Ole Miss for 
the first time.  Graduate students are only assessed the registration fee if registering in Phase 3.  
The dates for Phase 1, 2, and 3 registration periods can be found under Academic Calendars and 
the Course Schedule Information links at the following address https://registrar.olemiss.edu.
