Legal Residence Policy 

 
Legal Residence of Students ●  The University applies the definitions and conditions stated 
here as required by state law in the classification of students as residents or nonresidents for the 

assessment of fees. 

 

Requests for a review of residency classification should be submitted to the registrar; forms for 

this purpose are available from the Office of the Registrar. To be applicable for a particular 

semester, such requests must be accompanied by documentation that all residency requirements 

have been met by the last day to register for that semester. 

 

MINORS —  The residency of a minor (less than 21 years of age) is that of the father, the 

mother, or a general guardian duly appointed by a proper court in Mississippi. If a court has 

granted custody of the minor to one parent, the residence of the minor is that of the parent who 

was granted custody by the court. If both parents are dead, the residence of the minor is that of 

the last surviving parent at the time of that parent’s death, unless the minor lives with a general 

guardian, duly appointed by a proper court of Mississippi, in which case his residence becomes 

that of the guardian. A student who, upon registration at a Mississippi institution of higher 

learning or community college, presents a transcript demonstrating graduation from a Mississippi 

secondary school and who has been a secondary school student in Mississippi for not less than 

the final four (4) years of secondary school attendance shall not be required to pay out-of-state 

tuition. This section shall not apply to a person as it relates to residency for voter registration or 

voting. 

 

ADULTS — The legal residence of an adult is that place where he is domiciled, that is, the place 

where he actually physically resides with the intention of remaining there indefinitely or of 

returning there permanently when temporarily absent. 

 

REMOVAL OF PARENTS FROM MISSISSIPPI — If the parents of a minor who is enrolled as 

a student in an institution of higher learning move their legal residence from the state of 

Mississippi, the minor is immediately classified as a nonresident student. 

 

TWELVE MONTHS OF RESIDENCE REQUIRED — No student may be admitted to the 

University as a resident of Mississippi unless his residence, as defined above, has been in the 

state for a continuous period of at least 12 months immediately preceding his admission. 

 

RESIDENCE IN AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION CAN BE COUNTED — A student who 

has lived within the state for 12 months following his twenty-first birthday may establish 

residence in his own right by showing that he is living in the state with the intention of 

abandoning his former domicile and remaining in the state permanently, or for an indefinite 

length of time. 

 

RESIDENCE STATUS OF A MARRIED STUDENT — A married student may claim the 

residence of the spouse, or may claim independent residence status under the same regulations, 

set forth above, as any other adult.

CHILDREN OF PARENTS WHO ARE EMPLOYED BY THE UNIVERSITY — Dependent 

children of parents who are members of the faculty or staff of the University may be classified as 

residents without regard to the residence requirement of 12 months. 
 

MILITARY PERSONNEL ASSIGNED ON ACTIVE DUTY STATION IN MISSISSIPPI AND 

CHILDREN OF MILITARY PERSONNEL — 

(1) Resident status of a spouse or child of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States on 

extended active duty shall be that of the military spouse or parent for the purpose of attending 

state-supported institutions of higher learning and community/junior colleges of the State of 

Mississippi during the time that the military spouse or parent is stationed within the State of 

Mississippi and shall be continued through the time that the military spouse or parent is stationed 

in an overseas area with last duty assignment within the State of Mississippi, excepting 

temporary training assignments en route from Mississippi. Resident status of a minor child 

terminates upon reassignment under Permanent Change of Station Orders of the military parent 

for duty in the continental United States outside the State of Mississippi, excepting temporary 

training assignments en route from Mississippi, and except that children of members of the 

Armed Forces who attain Mississippi residency in accordance with the above provisions, who 

begin and complete their senior year of high school in Mississippi, and who enroll full time in a 

Mississippi institution of higher learning or community/junior college to begin studies in the fall 

after their graduation from high school, maintain their residency status so long as they remain 

enrolled as a student in good standing at a Mississippi institution of higher learning or 

community/junior college. Enrollment during summer school is not required to maintain such 

resident status. 

 

(2) The spouse or child of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States who dies or is 

killed is entitled to pay the resident tuition fee if the spouse or child becomes a resident of 

Mississippi 

 

(3) If a member of the Armed Forces of the United States is stationed outside Mississippi and the 

member's spouse or child establishes residence in Mississippi and registers with the Mississippi 

institution of higher learning or community/junior college at which the spouse or child plans to 

attend, the institution of higher education or community/junior college shall permit the spouse or 

child to pay the tuition, fees and other charges provided for Mississippi residents without regard 

to length of time that the spouse or child has resided in Mississippi. 

 

(4) A member of the Armed Forces of the United States or the child or spouse of a member of 

the Armed Forces of the United States who is entitled to pay tuition and fees at the rate provided 

for Mississippi residents under another provision of this section while enrolled in a degree or 

certificate program is entitled to pay tuition and fees at the rate provided for Mississippi residents 

in any subsequent term or semester while the person is continuously enrolled in the same degree 

or certificate program. A student may withdraw or may choose not to reenroll for no more than 

one (1) semester or term while pursuing a degree or certificate without losing resident status only 

if that student provides sufficient documentation by a physician that the student has a medical 

condition that requires withdrawal or non-enrollment. For purposes of this subsection, a person is 

not required to enroll in a summer term to remain continuously enrolled in a degree or certificate 

program. The person's eligibility to pay tuition and fees at the rate provided for Mississippi 

residents under this subsection does not terminate because the person is no longer a member of

the Armed Forces of the United States or the child or spouse of a member of the Armed Forces 

of the United States. 

 

 

CERTIFICATION OF RESIDENCE OF MILITARY PERSONNEL — A military person on 

active duty stationed in Mississippi who wishes to avail himself or his dependents of the 

provisions of the paragraph titled “Military Personnel Assigned on Active Duty Station in 

Mississippi” must submit a certificate from the military organization showing the name of the 

military member, the name of the dependent, if for a dependent, the name of the organization of 

assignment and its address (may be in the letterhead), that the military member will be on active 

duty stationed in Mississippi on the date of registration at the University; that the military 

member is not on transfer orders; and the signature of the commanding officer, the adjutant, or 

the personnel officer of unit of assignment with signer’s rank and title. A military certificate 

must be presented to the registrar of the University each semester at (or within 10 days prior to) 

registration for the provisions of the paragraph “Military Personnel Assigned Active Duty 

Station in Mississippi,” named above, to be effective. 

 

FAMILIES OF STUDENTS — The spouse and children of a nonresident student who pays or 

receives a waiver of the nonresident fee may enroll in the University upon payment of the 

appropriate fees charged to a resident. Nonresident fees for spouses and children of part-time 

nonresident students will be prorated. 

 

Responsibility of Students - Residency classification of an applicant for admission is determined 

by the Office of Admissions and is stated on the Admission Certificate issued. Students should 

notify the registrar immediately by letter of any change in legal residence.
