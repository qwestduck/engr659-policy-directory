Payments to Subcontracted Agencies 
 

Summary/Purpose:  A sub-contract or cost reimbursement contract is defined as a contract 
where a significant portion of a university grant or appropriation is assigned, but not limited to, 
State or Federal Agencies, Universities, Junior or Community Colleges, Local or Public Schools, 
or other Educational Institutions. 
 
 
 
These awards must be approved through the Office of Research and signed by the Vice

Payments to a subcontractor are processed on a Certification for Payments to be Made Under a 
Subcontract form, available from the Office of Research. The original itemized invoice must be 
attached to the signed and coded payment request document and routed to Procurement Services, 
where payment will be made.
