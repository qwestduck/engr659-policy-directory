Summary/Purpose:  The temporary loan of inventory items between departments. 
 
 
When a temporary loan of property between departments or to individuals is made, an

with the department since the department head is still held responsible for the item(s). 
Loan forms are only valid for one (1) year and must be renewed with the internal Property 
Office annually. 
 
When the property is returned to the loaning department by the borrower a copy must be 
forwarded to the internal Property Office stating the location of the item(s) returned.
