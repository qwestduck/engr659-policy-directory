University Crest

Summary/Purpose: To define the purpose of the University Crest.

The official Crest of the University was designed in 1965 to be used to symbolize all University
units and activities.  With the creation of the Crest, the University established the policy that the
Great Seal of the University would be used only on official documents.  The policy is to refuse
approval of various other symbols, seals, crests, etc., to represent various schools, departments,
institutes, etc. identified with the University.  There is a similar policy against special stationery
for various University units when the stationery varies widely from the style officially approved
by the Office of the Chancellor.

Use.

The University Seal shall be used only in connection with the transaction of business of The
University of Mississippi.  The seal may be affixed by the Secretary in the Office of the
Chancellor on any document signed on behalf of the University.  The Office of the Chancellor
may grant use of the seal in the decoration of any University document or in other special
circumstances.

Approval from the University of Mississippi Department of Licensing for any trademark which is
any mark, logo, symbol, nickname, letter(s), word or derivative that can be associated with the
University of Mississippi and can be distinguished from those of other institutions or entities.
