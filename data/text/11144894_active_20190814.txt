Use of Designated Member Review Subsequent to Full Committee Review 

 

Summary/Purpose:  Use of designated member review (DMR) to review animal study protocol 

subsequent to full committee review (FCR) when modifications are needed to secure approval. 

 

 

1. If all members of the IACUC are present at a meeting, they may vote to require 
modifications to secure approval and have the revised research protocol a) reviewed and 

approved by designated member review, or b) returned for FCR at a convened meeting.  

 

2. If all members of the IACUC are not present at a meeting, a quorum of members present at a 
convened meeting may, by unanimous vote, send the protocol to DMR subsequent to FCR 

when modification is needed to secure approval. However, any member of the IACUC may, 

at any time before the designated reviewers have completed their review, request to see the 

revised protocol and/or request FCR of the revised protocol.  

If the IACUC uses DMR, the approval date is the date that the designated member(s) approve the 

study.
