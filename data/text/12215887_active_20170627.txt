To prevent potential damage to ALL trees in ALL locations on campus, no enos, hammocks, slacklines 
and/or tether lines are allowed in trees.  Nothing can be tied, hung or wrapped around trees on campus. 
When enos, hammocks, slacklines and/or tether lines are tied, hung or wrapped around tree trunks or 
limbs they weaken, crack and wear away bark which renders infestation and disease.  It may also 
lacerate tree trunks and branches which increases the risk for potential failure.
