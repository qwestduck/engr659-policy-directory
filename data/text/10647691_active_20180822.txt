Policy Name:  Calculation of Financial Need 

 

Purpose:  This document contains the Office of Financial Aid’s current 

policies and procedures for determining financial need for 

awarding purposes.   

 

Disclaimer:  This policy is subject to change, without notice, in order to comply 

with administrative and regulatory requirements.  

 
 

As specified by the U.S. Department of Education, a student's financial need is determined by 

subtracting the Expected Family Contribution (“EFC”, also known as the student and/or family 

resources) from his/her Cost of Attendance (COA).   

 

The EFC is determined by the federal processor from data provided on the Free Application for 

Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), utilizing the federal methodology formula authorized by 

Congress. The EFC is used exclusively for the awarding of Federal Pell Grant.   

 

In contrast to Pell (and the Federal Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants), you must take other aid 

into account when awarding other need-based programs (such as the Federal Title IV 

Supplemental Opportunity Grant, Work-Study, and Federal Direct Subsidized Loan).  The 

following formula will apply: 

 

COA – EFC – Estimated Financial Assistance = Remaining Need 

 

Estimated Financial Assistance (EFA) includes other aid such as grants, scholarships, loans and 

need-based employment that can be anticipated at the time a school is packaging aid for a student, 

whether the assistance is awarded by the school or by an individual or organization outside the 

school.  

 

The only exception to this rule involves Americorps, which is included as estimated financial 

assistance in all cases except the determination of Federal Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility.  It is 

explicitly excluded in this calculation, per federal regulation. 

 

For the purposes of awarding institutional need-based aid, the University of Mississippi uses the 

federal definition of “financial need”.  Therefore, students are strongly encouraged to complete a 

FAFSA in order to be fully considered for all aid options.
