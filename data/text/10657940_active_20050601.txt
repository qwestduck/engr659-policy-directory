    b.   The material mailed will be of minimum quantity, normally one 8 Â½ x 11 page, with no  
           more than one brief, commercially-produced brochure and should be in an envelope no
           larger than a number 10, or folded to the approximate size of a number 10 envelope or  
           smaller and secured for mailing.  

c.   The list or service will be made available no more frequently than once a year, with any  
additional availability determined by substantial need due to change in benefits, 
regulations or product.

    d.   The Director of Human Resources will review and approve all such mailings prior to  
          distribution.
