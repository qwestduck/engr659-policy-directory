Grove Litter and Use 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Defines guidelines for the use of the Grove, including proper removal of 

litter. 

 

The Grove is a special and very unique part of Ole Miss. Special events such as concerts, 

weddings, etc. are handled through the Central Ticket Office, (662) 915-7411. 

 

After a person or group has booked an event(s) in the Grove through the Central Ticket Office, 

they should contact Landscape Services at (662) 915-1846 to verify proper litter control is in 

place. The person booking the event is responsible for ensuring all litter is removed from the 

Grove and placed in proper waste disposal dumpsters. The University can provide extra trash 

cans and litter pick up during and/or after an event. There is a charge for this service. To request 

this service, contact Landscape Services at (662) 915-1846. Persons or groups failing to properly 

remove litter and other objects from the Grove within 2 hours of the completion of the event will 

be charged for the clean up by the University. 

 

As a reminder, for your safety, there is no staking of any kind in the Grove due to underground 

utility lines. No vehicles are allowed in the Grove. 

 

To prevent potential damage to trees, no hammocks and/or slacklines are allowed in trees. 

Nothing can be tied, hung or wrapped around trees.  When hammocks and/or slacklines are tied, 

hung or wrapped around tree trunks or limbs they weaken, crack and wear away bark which 

renders infestation and disease.  It may also lacerate or girdle tree trunks and branches and 

increases the risk for potential failure.
