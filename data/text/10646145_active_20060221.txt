Chief Executive Officers 

Summary/Purpose:  The purpose of this policy is to inform all of the title of the Chief
Executive Officer of The University of Mississippi.

From its establishment in 1848 to November 21, 1859, the chief executive officers of the
University were designated “president.”  Then, at the instigation of President Barnard, the title
was changed to “chancellor.”  On July 27, 1886, the title of chancellor was abolished, and the
head of the institution was known as “chairman of the faculty.”  The title of “chancellor” was
restored August 6, 1889.
