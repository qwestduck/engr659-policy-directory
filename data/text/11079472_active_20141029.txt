The University of Mississippi 

Fourth Amendment Rights 
 
Summary/Purpose:  To make students aware of their right to be secure from unreasonable or 
unauthorized search and seizure. 
 
 
Students at The University of Mississippi have the right to be secure from unreasonable or 
unauthorized search and seizure.   
 
Students living in property on the University’s campus maintain their Fourth Amendment rights 
guaranteed by the United States Constitution to be free from unreasonable search and seizure of 
their property by law enforcement officials.  However, officials of the University may enter a 
student’s campus residence if such inspection is deemed to be in the best interest of the 
University, including for the purposes of maintenance, health and safety, or if there is a belief 
that University policy is being violated.  Except in cases involving the service of a legal search 
warrant or situations relating to fire hazards, mechanical malfunctions, energy consumption, 
general maintenance of physical facilities, property control, and personal safety of the residents, 
no student’s campus residence may be entered when no occupants are present.
