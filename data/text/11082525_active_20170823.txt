 Correspondence Review Service 

Summary/Purpose:  To define the guidelines for using the Correspondence Review Service. 

The  Correspondence Review Service allows students to drop off resumes, cover letters or other 

employment correspondence for staff to review and offer suggestions for improvement.   

Documents will be edited by staff within a 48-72 hour time period, unless the service is 

requested during peak times or as part of a class assignment.   

Students who submit documents for review as part of a class assignment or during peak times are 

asked to allow the Career Center staff a minimum of three (3) days to complete the review 

process. 

Handouts, books, and other resources are available in the Career Resource room to assist 

students with preparing initial drafts for review.  If the documents submitted for review require 

extensive changes, students will be invited to schedule an appointment with a staff member.  

Contact the Career Center at 915.7174 for additional questions regarding the Correspondence 

Review Service.
