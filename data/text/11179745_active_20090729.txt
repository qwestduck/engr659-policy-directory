The University of Mississippi 
 

Purchase of Energy Star Certified Products 
 

Summary/Purpose: The University of Mississippi has adopted an ENERGY STAR 
Procurement Policy as a part of the Chancellor’s signing of the President’s Climate 
Commitment. The university joins nearly 400 institutions that have committed to a similar 
procurement policy to help do our part in conserving energy. 
 
In all areas for which Energy Star ratings exist, the University of Mississippi will make a 
dedicated effort to purchase products that are Energy Star certified or meet the performance 
requirements for Energy Star certification. University departments are encouraged to seek out 
and purchase Energy Star products whenever possible or feasible.   
 
The University of Mississippi recognizes that some Energy Star products carry a premium when 
compared with their less efficient counterparts. The Energy Star guidelines are designed to 
ensure that the premium is more than offset by the energy savings and environmental benefits 
accrued over the product’s lifetime, and a review of those savings will occur in the consideration 
of that purchase.  The Energy Star website has a calculator to assist with the comparison of 
products:  http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=bulk_purchasing.bus_purchasing.
