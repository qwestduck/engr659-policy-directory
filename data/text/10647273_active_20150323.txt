Lofts and Bunk Beds 
 

Summary/Purpose: This policy explains Student Housing and Residence Life’s expectations for 

beds with regard to bunking beds and using lofts. In addition, this policy provides information 

for ordering lofts through the University’s only approved loft vendor. 

 

The beds in all residence hall rooms are designed for bunking. These beds also are adjustable 

providing up to 34" of clearance. Students are responsible for bunking and un-bunking their 

beds. Bunking pins are available at the front desk of each residence hall. Due to the quick turn 

around and getting rooms ready for Summer term, students are expected to return their beds to 

the original position at the end of the Spring semester. Only students who are continuing in the 

same room for Summer term are exempt for this mandate. Students failing to return their beds to 

the original position will be billed. 

 

Cinder blocks and homemade lofts are not permitted in the residence halls for safety and liability 

reasons. Lofts, specifically designed for the beds in the residence halls, are available for rent 

from Lofts, Inc. These are the only lofts that will be permitted in the residence halls. These lofts 

are easily assembled and less expensive than purchasing your own loft. In addition, a percentage 

of the rental fee is contributed annually to the Residential Scholar Scholarship Fund. For more 

information or an order form, contact Lofts, Inc. at Brittco Commercial Furniture and Interiors, 

(662) 561-1050 or visit http://www.loftsinc.com.
