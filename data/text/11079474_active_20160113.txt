Fraud or False Identification
 
DSA.SC.200.005
 

Summary/Purpose: To provide students with notice of their duty to exercise personal and 
professional integrity by abstaining from acts of fraud, including misuse of University or 
government-issued identification. 

Students at the University of Mississippi will demonstrate integrity by refraining from altering, 
falsifying, or misusing student documents or University documents, records, or forms of 
identification.  Students will also refrain from misusing any state-issued or federally-issued 
identification (i.e., driver’s license), including possessing a fake or fictitious identification, or 
possessing identification belonging to someone other than themselves. 

Additional examples of fraud include, but are not limited to, the following: providing false 
information to the University, forgery, unauthorized alteration of any official documentation, 
misuse of a University official’s signature, misuse of University parking permits, 
misrepresenting one’s identity, inappropriate use of a student identification card, misuse of 
information technology user id’s and/or passwords, fraudulent misrepresentation or 
concealment of one’s organizational affiliation(s) or sponsorship(s). Unauthorized use of the 
name of the University or the names of members or organizations in the University community 
is also considered fraud. Students who act inconsistently with this value and policy will be 
subject to conduct charges and proceedings.
