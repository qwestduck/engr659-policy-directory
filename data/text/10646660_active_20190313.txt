Delinquent Accounts 
 

Summary/Purpose:  The University of Mississippi Bursar’s policy on handling of delinquent 
accounts. 
 
 
Regular student account balances and student loan balances are collected by the Bursar’s Office, 
and, if not paid, constitute a delinquent account.  The University reserves the right to withhold 
re-admission and/or registration for future terms to a student until all delinquent amounts owed 
to the University have been paid.  Diplomas and course transcripts are not issued for students 
whose accounts are delinquent.  Delinquent accounts may be referred to a collection agency, in 
which case the account will be assessed all costs of collection, including all the fees payable to 
any collection agency, which may be based on a percentage at a maximum of 33% of the debt 
and all costs and expenses including reasonable attorney’s fees, which the University incurs in 
such collection efforts, whether or not a lawsuit is commenced as part of the collection process.  
Delinquent accounts may also be reported to one or more of the national credit bureaus.
