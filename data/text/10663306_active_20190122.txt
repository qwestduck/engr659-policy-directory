Administrative Leave for Jury Duty, Witness, and Election 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Information regarding leave time for serving as a witness, juror, or party 

litigant, assisting with certain elections, and voting during an election is given. 

 

 

Permanent, full-time and part-time employees serving as a witness, juror, or party litigant, as 

verified by the clerk of the court, may be granted Administrative Leave with pay by the 

Chancellor. 

  

If asked to assist with a school district, municipal, county, state, or federal election, an employee 

may have time off with pay. He/she is expected, however, to make arrangements with his/her 

supervisor. Most employees live or work close enough to the polls to vote before or after 

working hours. Should this not be possible, one may have time off with pay, to vote in a county, 

state, or federal election.
