PERSONAL PROPERTY 

 

Summary/Purpose: This policy explains that the University of Mississippi is not responsible 

for personal property in the residence halls. The policy encourages students to be sure that 

their parents’ homeowner’s insurance covers their belongings while in college, or to 

purchase personal property insurance before coming to school.  

 

The University of Mississippi assumes no liability for damage or loss of personal property. This 

includes but is not limited to interruption of utilities, power surges, flooding, fire, theft, 

vandalism, and/or student misconduct. Students are encouraged to check family’s homeowner’s 

insurance for coverage. In addition, it is highly recommended that the student purchase 

renter’s insurance to cover any loss that may occur. All personal property must be stored 

in resident rooms and not in hallways. Any items left in hallways will be discarded.
