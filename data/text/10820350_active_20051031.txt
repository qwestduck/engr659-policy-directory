Promotional Items 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Promotional or similar items used for the recruitment of students. 
 
Promotional or similar items used for the recruitment of students may be purchased with 
University funds with proper justification. Payment of the invoice in question must be 
accompanied by a clear and detailed written justification from the signatory officer. The written 
statement will then become part of the payment record, which is made available for inspection to 
any Internal, State or Federal Auditors. Failure to include or furnish the justification will 
cause the invoice to be classified as a personal charge.
