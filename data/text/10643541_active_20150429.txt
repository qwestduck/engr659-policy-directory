Media Relations Policy 
 
Summary/Purpose: To ensure accurate and consistent communication to all 
media. 
 
In order to ensure all university messages are presented accurately and 
consistently, the office of University Communications is responsible for 
conducting and/or coordinating all contact with media (including print, broadcast, 
online, documentary, network television and other types of media outlets). This 
includes but is not limited to: 

 Official university statements, announcements and activities; 

 The writing and distribution of press releases; 

 Formal and informal efforts to place stories in media outlets (including 
print, broadcast, and online);  

 The posting of university news or stories on department or center web 
sites (unless already posted to Ole Miss News); 

 Release of official statements or information to the general public through 
mass media or social media (including but not limited to information about 
emergencies, crimes, controversies, official positions on issues involving 
the university and other events to which the press has reasonable claim). 

 All media contacts for official university information or for faculty expertise 
(whether initiated by the media or the university partner). 

 

* Exceptions to this policy include athletics, which manages media relations 
through its sports information office. However, University Communications will be 
consulted regarding responses to all significant issues that have the potential to 
reflect upon the image of the university.
