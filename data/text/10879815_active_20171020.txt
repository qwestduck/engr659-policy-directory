Delegating Authority to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
 
Summary/Purpose: To define and explain the delegation of authority to the IRB in policy-
making in regard to policies which have or may have bearing on the IRB and/or its functions. 
 
DEFINITION OF THE DISCRETE CATEGORY OF UNIVERSITY POLICIES 
AFFECTED 
 This policy covers only policies bearing on the functions of the IRB, which are based on 

federal and state law (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45 Part 46 and Title 21 Part 50: 
Protection of Human Subjects, Mississippi Code § 41-41-17). 

 
INITIATION OF POLICY PROPOSALS, RESPONSIBLE OFFICE, POLICY 
DEVELOPMENT, AND POLICY APPROVAL 
 Policies are proposed based on requirements of the federal regulations, state laws, and the 

interpretation of those regulations to protect human research subjects by authorized OHRP 
personnel. 

 Suggestions for new proposals and review for merit come from IRB members. 
 The IRB consults with the Vice Chancellor for Research and Sponsored Programs, the 

University Attorneys, and other administrative and academic departments that conduct 
human subjects research on policy development. 

 
POLICY APPROVAL 
 Final policy approval requires a majority vote of the IRB. 
 
REGULAR REVIEW OF POLICIES 
 The Responsible Office, the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs Division of 

Research Integrity and Compliance, will schedule policy reviews for usefulness and 
consistency with applicable federal regulations and state laws, Institutes of Higher Learning 
(IHL) Policies and Bylaws, and other University Policies every two years following policy 
approval or more frequently. 

 If the IRB determines that changes to an IRB Policy are necessary or prudent as a part of the 
Scheduled Review or at any other time, the IRB may propose a policy change consistent with 
this Policy.
