Class Enrollment by Members of the Instructor’s Immediate Family 

Summary/Purpose:  Regulations are given regarding a faculty member’s immediate family 
enrolling in a course taught by that faculty member.  A definition of immediate family is given 
along with an explanation of procedures to follow for exceptions that may arise. 

Because of the appearance of a potential conflict of interest, immediate family members at the 
University of Mississippi are discouraged from enrolling in courses taught by that faculty 
member.  For the purpose of this policy, immediate family is defined to include parents, spouses, 
children, and descendants of the faculty member and his or her spouse. Situations may 
nevertheless arise where, in order to complete the requirements for a degree or to fulfill some 
other valid educational purpose, immediate family members may wish to enroll in a course 
taught by a faculty member.  

Whenever an immediate family member of an instructor seeks to enroll in a course taught by that 
faculty member, the instructor must obtain explicit approval for such enrollment from the 
department chair and appropriate academic dean. In granting special permission for an 
immediate family member to enroll in the instructor's course, the department chairperson and 
dean may impose special conditions.
