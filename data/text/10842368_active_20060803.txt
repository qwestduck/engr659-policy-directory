Waste Removal 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Defines guidelines for the use of trash dumpsters on campus. 

The University community is provided dumpsters for trash collection for the disposal of campus 
generated material only.  Disposal of private household waste in University dumpsters or other 
trash receptacles is prohibited.  Because of the unknown nature of the contents of a trash 
container, and the potential safety hazard those unknown contents pose, individuals entering or 
removing items from dumpsters, or other trash receptacles, on campus is prohibited. The days 
when practically anything could be sent to the landfill are long since passed. If you have 
questions about what can go into a dumpster, accidentally discard an item into a dumpster, or if 
you wish to report a hazardous material that was improperly placed into a dumpster or campus 
trash receptacle, contact Landscape Services, (662) 915-1846.  

Dumpster Do’s:  

• Place items inside dumpster.  Do not stack items outside dumpster as the dumpster can 
not be emptied if items are stacked or blocking the dumpster.  

• Broken glass should be placed in a cardboard box, taped shut, and marked as broken 
glass prior to its placement in the trash dumpster.  

• If you are unsure how to properly dispose of your campus waste, contact Health and 
Safety or Landscape Services Department.  

• If you need a dumpster serviced, call Campus Dispatch at (662) 915-7087 or Landscape 
Services at (662) 915-1846.
