Student Residence Damages 
 

Summary/Purpose:  This policy explains that any damages done to a residence hall room or 
apartment are the responsibility of the occupants of the room.  
  
  
Damages to student rooms or apartments are the responsibility of the occupant(s). Damage 
charges will be shared equally by all roommates unless the resident provides written notice to the 
Residence Hall Director of the student(s) responsible for the damage. Depending upon the nature 
of the damage, (broken items, cleanliness, etc.) the resident(s) who occupy the room may face 
University judicial action in addition to damage charges and any labor charges incurred. To 
prevent misinterpretation, students should inspect their rooms thoroughly when completing the 
Room Condition Report (RCR) or Apartment Inspection form upon taking occupancy of a room.
