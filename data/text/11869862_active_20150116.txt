Incentive Compensation Prohibited 

Summary/Purpose:  Incentive compensation cannot be paid to individuals for success in 

recruiting students or for success in obtaining financial aid for students. 

Affected individuals:  Staff involved in recruitment and financial aid processing 

The University of Mississippi will not provide any commission, bonus or any other incentive 

payment to any individual based, whether directly or indirectly, on that individual’s success in 

recruiting students for enrollment or in obtaining financial aid for students.  While this 

prohibition applies to all employees and to third parties recruiting in the United States, special 

caution should be taken when processing salary and/or wage increases for individuals involved 

in the Office of Admissions, the Office of Financial Aid, Athletics, and the Graduate School.  

Anyone with a question about whether a certain factor may be considered in determining 

whether a pay increase is justified, should contact the Office of General Counsel (915-7014).
