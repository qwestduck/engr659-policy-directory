Effort Certification for Exempt Employees 

Summary/Purpose:  Effort directly charged to, or cost shared on, federal or state funded 
sponsored projects must be certified through the university's electronic effort reporting 
system.  Using suitable means of verification, Principal Investigator(s) must certify that 
effort percentages reasonably reflect actual effort devoted to their sponsored agreement(s) 
by employees during the certification period.  There are three certification periods for the 
university that coincide with the spring, summer and fall academic semesters. 

Effort is reported as a percentage of total activities, not of total hours worked.  Therefore, 
all of an employee's compensated activities equal 100% effort regardless of whether the 
activities are accomplished in 20, 40 or 80 hours per week.  Employees working 100% on 
sponsored projects must ensure they are not performing any other university duties such 
as teaching a class, writing competitive proposals, etc. without adjusting their effort 
accordingly to reflect those duties.   

Effort certifications must be completed within a reasonable time (typically within 60 days 
after the end of the certification period).  Failure to certify effort on a timely basis may 
result in project accounts being locked pending receipt of the reports.  

Adjustments or cost transfers of salaries and wages should be timely processed before the 
end of the certification period.  Once a certification period has ended, adjustments or cost 
transfers of salaries must be made via the effort certification process.  Payroll distribution 
and effort as certified must be within a 5% variance.
