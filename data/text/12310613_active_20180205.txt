HIPAA Policy:  Security 12 

 

 

 

 

Summary:  Classifying data in HIPAA covered entities and setting baseline 

security measures 
 

Affected Individuals:  Employees in HIPAA covered entities; IT staff 

 

Purpose of Policy 

The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for classifying data in the possession of University 
of Mississippi (UM) and its workforce members and to define the baseline security controls for handling 
and safeguarding information assets. 

 
The resulting data classification categories determine which UM data requires special protection 
safeguards, security controls, and risk reduction measures. 

 

The purpose of this policy is to establish the minimum security controls for handling, labeling and storing 
UM’s data in order to protect the data from unauthorized disclosure or misuse. 

 
Definitions 

For a complete list of definitions, refer to the Glossary. 

 
Scope 

This policy applies only to covered entities as defined in the University of Mississippi (UM) HIPAA hybrid 
policy. 

This policy applies to all electronic data that is generated or used as part of UM’s covered entity business 
operations. 

 

This policy covers all UM data regardless of where the information is stored, including UM owned or 
managed systems or on a third party-hosted service. 

 
All workforce members, including third parties, who may have access or exposure to UM data are 
required to comply with this policy. 

 
Policy 

A. Classification of Data 

1. All UM data is classified into one of three sensitivity levels (tiers). 



 

Data Classification and Handling 
HIPAA Policy:  Security 12 

 

 

 

2. Data owners may assign a single classification to a collection of data that is common in 
purpose or function. When classifying a collection of data, the most restrictive classification 
of any of the individual data elements is used to classify the entire body of data as a whole. 

B. Tier 1: Confidential Data 

1. Data is classified as confidential data when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration or 
destruction of that data causes a significant level of risk. Confidential data is always 
sensitive. 

2. The highest level of security controls apply to confidential data. Access to confidential data 
must be controlled from creation to destruction. Access is only granted to those persons 
who require such access in order to perform their job (“need-to-know”) in accordance with 
the principle of least privilege. Access to confidential data may be authorized to groups of 
persons based on job classification or responsibilities (“role-based” access). 

3. Access to confidential data must be authorized by the data owner who is responsible for the 
data. 

4. Based on state, federal, and contractual requirements, protected health information (PHI) 
covered under HIPAA is defined as confidential data and must be protected. 

5. Based on state, federal, and contractual requirements, personally identifiable health 
information (PII) covered under HIPAA is defined as confidential data and must be 
protected. 

6. Payment Card Information (PCI) covered under PCI DSS (Data Security Standard) is defined 
as confidential data and must be protected. Payment card information is defined as a credit 
card number (also referred to as a primary account number or PAN) in combination with 
one or more of the following data elements: 

 Cardholder name 
 Service code 
 Expiration date 



 

Data Classification and Handling 
HIPAA Policy:  Security 12 

 

 

 

 CVC2, CVV2 or CID value 
 PIN or PIN block 
 Contents of a credit card’s magnetic stripe 

C. Tier 1: Confidential Data Examples 

1. Data protected by state or federal regulations including: 

 Protected Health Information (PHI) 

 Personally Identifiable Information (PII) 
 Social Security Numbers (SSN) 
 Payment Card Information (PCI or Credit/Debit Card Data) 
 Financial Account Data 
 Data as identified in the Mississippi Data Breach Notification Law 

2. Data protected by confidentiality agreements, including: 

 Employee personnel records 
 Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA). 

3. Internal UM information that must be protected from unauthorized internal or external 
disclosure, including: 

 Merger / acquisition sensitive info 

 Financial reports and budget information 
 Sensitive Executive Officer correspondence or information 
 Intellectual property 
 Credentialing information (e.g., credentials, password data) that grants access to 

systems storing sensitive data 
 Legal products, including legal correspondence and data that is subject to attorney- 

client privilege 

4. Legal hold data that are the subject of (or are anticipated to be the subject of) any type of 
investigation and/or legal proceeding.

HIPAA Policy:  Security 12 

 

 

 

D. Tier 2: Internal Use Only Data 

1. Data is classified as internal use only data when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration or 
destruction causes a low-to-moderate level of risk. Internal use only data is not for release 
to the general public. Internal use only data is always sensitive. 

2. A reasonable level of security controls apply to internal use only data. 

3. By default, all data that are not explicitly classified as confidential data or public data are to 
be treated as internal use only data. 

4. Access to internal use only data must be authorized by the data owner who is responsible 
for the data. Access to internal use only data may be authorized to groups of persons based 
on job classification or responsibilities (“role-based” access). 

5. Tier 2: Internal Use Only Data Examples: 

 Internal company newsletters 
 Training program materials 
 Project plans / documentation 
 Operations meeting notes 
 Operations policies and procedures 

E. Tier 3: Public Data 

1. Data is classified as public data when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration or destruction 
of that data results in little or no risk. Public data is not sensitive but does require a data 
owner. While little or no controls are required to protect the confidentiality of public data, 
some level of control is required to prevent unauthorized modification or destruction of 
public data. 

2. As public data is not considered sensitive, access may be granted to any requester or 
published with no restrictions. The integrity of public data is protected and the data owner 
takes measures to ensure public data remains accurate over time.

3. Tier 3: Public Data Examples: 

 Provider directory information 
 Public event information 
 Research publications 

F. Data Handling, Labeling, and Storage Requirements 

1. All UM data is handled, labeled, and stored in accordance with this policy based upon its 
data classification. 

2. Procedures for handling, processing, communication and storage of information (including 
information media awaiting disposal) are established to protect data from unauthorized 
disclosure or misuse including: 

 Physical and technical access restrictions commensurate with the data classification 
level 

 Handling and labeling of all media according to its indicated classification (sensitivity) 
level 

 Periodic review (at a minimum annually) of distribution and authorized recipient lists 
 Monitoring the status and location of media containing unencrypted confidential 

information 

Note: Any data covered by federal or state laws or regulations or contractual agreements 
must also meet the security requirements defined by those laws, regulations, or contracts in 
addition to the requirements of this policy. 

G. Minimum Security Controls 

The following table specifies the minimum security controls for UM’s confidential data, 
internal-use-only data, and public data:
