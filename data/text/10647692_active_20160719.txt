Battery Disposal and Recycling 
 

Summary/Purpose:  The Battery Disposal and Recycling Policy details the minimum 
requirements and procedures for the environmentally safe recycling of batteries.  
 
Battery Recycling Most rechargeable batteries are regulated as hazardous waste when 
discarded. Laboratory Services collects and recycles the following types of rechargeable 
batteries: 

NiCad Batteries (Regulated because of the toxic metal Cadmium.)  

                                                                  

Lead Acid and Lead-Gel Batteries (Regulated because of the toxic metal Lead.)  

                                                      

Mercury (button) Batteries (Regulated because of the toxic metal Mercury.)  

                                                                     

Lithium Batteries (Regulated because of the water reactive metal Lithium.)  

                                                                       

In order to fully comply with applicable regulations, Laboratory Services will accept these 
batteries from all campus sources for proper disposal.  

The Facilities Management Service Station (915) - 7304 will receive Vehicle Batteries from all 
campus sources at no charge. The service station will not pick up car batteries. Please call the 
station or Facilities Management (915) - 7051 if you need additional instruction or directions.
