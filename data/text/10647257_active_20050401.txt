Vehicle Marking 
 

Summary/Purpose:  State regulations pertaining to the marking of state owned vehicles. 
 
 
Marking 
All state vehicles owned or leased by any agency of the State shall have a permanent decal or 
paint on both sides of the vehicle in letters at least three (3) inches in height and on the rear in 
letters not less than one and one-half (1Â½) inches in height, state the name of the university. The 
marking must be in a color, which is in contrast with the color of the vehicle. Section 25-1-87, 
Mississippi Code of 1972, Annotated, allows a few exemptions of marking for law enforcement 
vehicles. The State Property Office is required to report to the Joint Legislative Committee on 
Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review (PEER Committee) vehicles with improper 
markings, as well as those which have no markings at all. 
 
Unmarked 
Section 25-1-87, Mississippi Code of 1972, Annotated, allows the Governor to authorize specific 
use of unmarked vehicles only in instances where such identifying marks will hinder official 
investigations.  In the event the request is granted, the Governor shall furnish the Office of the 
State Auditor with a copy of his written authority for the use of the unmarked vehicle, a copy is 
forwarded to the department who must submit a copy to the University Property Office. Persons 
desiring to use unmarked vehicles should contact the Procurement Services Department.
