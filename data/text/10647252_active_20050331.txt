Liability for Failure to Make Inventory 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Consequences for failure to produce all items listed on inventory. 
 
 
Section 29-9-17, Mississippi Code of 1972, Annotated, states if any officer or employee of any 
state agency shall refuse or fail to make any inventory in the manner prescribed by the State 
Auditor, the State Auditor shall proceed to make, or cause to be made, the inventory, and the 
expense thereof shall be personally borne by said officer or employee, and he/she shall be 
responsible on his/her official bond for the payment of the expense. 
 
In the event that an examination conducted pursuant to this section finds items included on an 
agency’s inventory, which are missing, and otherwise unaccounted for, the State Auditor has the 
authority to proceed under the provisions of Section 7-7-211, Mississippi Code of 1972, 
Annotated to recover the value of the missing items. The demand shall be made against the head 
of the agency, the agency’s property officer and/or the appropriate officer or employee, if 
identified. 
 
Section 29-9-21, Mississippi Code of 1972, Annotated, provides for more accurate, detailed and 
readily available inventory information on all state property, said records to be maintained on 
machine equipment in the office of the auditor of public accounts. It shall be the duty of the 
Auditor to maintain his/her records complete and current and make such reports to the Governor 
and the legislature whenever required, or when the said Auditor, in his/her discretion, 
finds it necessary to make other and additional reports. As a result of this directive, the fixed 
assets reporting system was developed for the use by the state agencies and universities in order 
to provide statewide property information.
