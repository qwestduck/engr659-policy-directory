Course Requirements or Credits for University of Mississippi 
Students to Participate as Research Subjects 

 
Summary/Purpose: Instructors cannot mandate or unduly influence student research subject 
participation. 
 
Student participation as research subjects must be completely voluntary.  If research participation 
is a course requirement and/or extra credit is offered for participation, students must be given 
alternatives that involve comparable time and effort in order to minimize possible undue 
influence on the decision to participate. 
 
Students must not be penalized for refusing to participate in research.
