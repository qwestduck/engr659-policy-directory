Equipment Acquisition - General 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Purchasing equipment items with Purchase Orders and Procurement Card. 

 

Purchase Order 

When departments submit requisitions to Procurement Services for the purchase of equipment 

items, the requisitions should be coded with an object code in the 8000 series indicating an 

equipment purchase. Any other related items listed on the requisition, such as cables, etc., that 

are not classified as equipment must be coded as commodities under the 6000 series object code. 

The cost of all items placed on inventory shall include charges associated with shipping.  An 

expense report verifying the purchase order is sent via e-mail to signatory officers.
