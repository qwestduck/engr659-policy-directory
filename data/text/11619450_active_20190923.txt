SUPERVISION OF MINORS  
  

Summary/Purpose:  To provide the minimum standard for appropriate supervision of Minors 

on campus and Minors who are involved in University-sponsored programs, programs held at the 

University, or programs housed in or through the University.   

  

Policy:  

 

1. One-on-One Contact: No person 18 years of age or older shall have One-On-One Contact 

with Minors.   

  

2. Duty to Report: If any person has reason to suspect that a Minor has been subject to neglect 

or abuse, he or she must:   

  

• Inform the Mississippi Child Protective Services by calling the Abuse hotline (800-222-

8000 or 601-432-4570) and provide written notification to the Department of Child 

Protective Services as soon thereafter as possible, which may be done on their website at 

https://www.mdcps.ms.gov/report-child-abuse-neglect/ See Miss. Code Ann. § 43-21-353  

• Inform the University Police Department (662-915-7234) or other appropriate law 

enforcement agency, and if the suspected assault or abuse presents an imminent danger to 

a Minor, contact should occur immediately.   

• If the Minor is a participant in a Program, inform the Program Director immediately. The  

Program Director will immediately notify the University Police Department and the Title 

IX Coordinator or designee. If the Program Director may be involved in the suspected 

assault or abuse the person should report the suspected assault or abuse to the 

University’s Title IX Coordinator or designee (662-915-7045).  

  

3. “See Something, Say Something”: If any person witnesses a violation of this policy, such 

as One-on-One Contact, or anything that gives rise to concern for the health or safety of a 

Minor, that person shall immediately notify the University’s Title IX Coordinator or designee 

(662-915-7045).   

  

4. Email, Text or Other Messaging with Minors: Staff, Program Staff, and Faculty must 

comply with the IT Appropriate Use Policy when communicating with students, including 

Minors. The entire policy is available on the University website in the Policy Directory. The 

“olemiss.edu” addresses are the only email addresses that should be used when 

communicating with students, including students who may be Minors. When teaching a class 

or online class with students who are Minors and the class contains a synchronous 

component, such as Skype or Adobe WebConnect, this should only be used for official 

communications and should not be conducted with Minors without first notifying parents, 

guardians, and the University.

The following are examples of violations of the laws of the State of Mississippi which may 

be related to online and text communications: 

 Enticement of a child through computer or other means is a crime under Mississippi 

Code Section 97-5-33. 

 Public display of sexually oriented materials in a venue likely to be visited by minors 

in the normal course of business is a crime under Mississippi Code Section 97-5-29. 

 Profane or indecent language in a public place is a crime under Mississippi Code 

Section 97-29-47. A web page which resides on a University server is a public place. 

 Publishing or exhibiting obscene materials to a Minor is a crime under Mississippi 

Code Section 97-5-27. 

 

The University may examine, at any time, anything that is stored or transmitted by the 

University-owned equipment.  

 

5. All Sponsoring Units offering or approving a Program which involves Minors shall:  

  

a. Follow all University policies and other laws or regulations applicable to Program 

activities.  

  

b. Require all Authorized Adults to undergo and pass a current, background check initiated 

by the University before beginning work with Minors. To be considered “current” the 

background check must have occurred within the previous three (3) years, though 

background checks may be conducted more frequently (e.g.: bi-annually, annually, semi-

annually, etc.) at the Program Director’s discretion.  Results of background checks must 

be reviewed and approved by the University’s Title IX Coordinator or designee prior to 

being hired and/or interacting with Minors in a Program. Payment for the background 

check is the responsibility of the individual unless specifically authorized for processing 

and/or payment by the Sponsoring Unit. Authorized Adults are under a duty to disclose to 

the Program Director any arrest that occurs after a background check is performed within 

72 hours of its occurrence or immediately if such occurs while working as Program Staff.  

The Program Director will then consult with the Title IX Coordinator and Human 

Resources to determine the appropriate action. 

  

c. Require all Authorized Adults and encourage all other Program Staff to participate in 

annual, mandatory Supervision of Minors training approved by the Title IX Coordinator 

or designee.  

  

d. Require Sponsoring Units to train Program Staff concerning the requirements of this 

Policy.  

  

e. Require that all Minors age 4 or under are accompanied by the Minor’s Guardian, unless 

the Program is a licensed day care facility.   

  

f. Ensure that no Minor age 8 or under participates in a Residential Program.   



The University of Mississippi

g. Ensure adequate supervision of Minors while they participate in any Program. All  

Program activities involving Minors must be supervised by at least two or more 

Authorized Adults. Some factors to consider in determining "adequate supervision" are 

the number, age, and gender of participants, the activities involved, and age, gender, and 

experience of the Authorized Adult.  An appointment as a Program Staff member is not 

equivalent to an appointment as an Authorized Adult.  Program Staff may not supervise 

Minors, unless the Program Staff members are also Authorized Adults. 

  

Consistent with American Association of Camps (“ACA”) staffing ratios, the ratio of 

Authorized Adults supervising Day Program participants shall meet the following during 

any Program activities:  

  

• One Authorized Adult for every 6 Minors ages 4-5; 

• One Authorized Adult for every 8 Minors ages 6-8; 

• One Authorized Adult for every 10 Minors ages 9-14; and 

• One Authorized Adult for every 12 Minors ages 15-17. 

  

For Residential Programs, during those times the Program participants are not engaged in 

Day Program activities, including at night, the minimum ratio of Authorized Adults 

supervising Program participants are:   

  

• The University does not sponsor residential programs for minors under the age of  

8. 

• One Authorized Adult for every 6 minors age 8; 

• One Authorized Adult for every 8 Minors ages 9-14; and 

• One Authorized Adult for every 10 Minors ages 15-17. 

  

These ratios shall not be required for non-residential Programs when Minors are brought 

to and supervised on campus by a representative of the school the Minors attend.  

  

These ratios shall not be required for classes that are offered for credit by an accredited 

educational institution in University classrooms located in academic buildings during 

normal business hours.    

  

h. Require Sponsoring Units offering or approving a Program to, at all times, designate an 

Authorized Adult at least 21 years of age to be on-call and accessible to Program 

participants at all times.   

  

i. Programs which include a RESIDENTIAL component must adopt and implement 

policies for proper supervision of Minors in University housing, including policies 

requiring the following:   

  



The University of Mississippi  

Page 4 of 9  

i) Written permission signed by the parent or legal guardian for the Minor to reside in 

University housing;  

 

ii) An age-appropriate curfew for the participants, but in no case later than midnight;  

  

iii) In-room visitation restricted to participants of the same gender; 

 

iv) Guests of participants (other than a parent/legal guardian and other Program 

participants) restricted to visitation in the building lobby and/or floor lounges, and 

only during approved hours specified by the Program;  

  

v) Compliance with all security measures and procedures specified by the UM 

Department of Student Housing and the University Police Department; and  

  

vi) Separate sleeping accommodations for adults and Minors other than the Minors’ 

parents, legal guardians, or other members of Minors’ immediate family.  

  

j. RESIDENTIAL Programs and Programs which involve AQUATIC ACTIVITY (such as 

swimming) OR OTHER STRENUOUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY shall:   

  

i) Establish a procedure for the notification of the Minor's parent or legal guardian in 

case of emergency, including medical or behavioral problems, natural disasters, or 

other significant Program disruptions. Authorized Adults with the Program as well as 

participants and their parent or legal guardians must be advised of this procedure in 

writing prior to the Program.   

  

ii) Require the Program participant to provide the Sponsoring Unit a Medical Treatment 

Authorization form. All forms must include the following:  

a) A statement informing the parent/legal guardian that the University does not 

provide medical insurance to cover medical care for the Minor (unless the 

Program provides such insurance).  

b) A statement authorizing the release of medical information (HIPAA) and 

authorizing emergency treatment in case the parent/legal guardian cannot be 

reached for permission.  

c) A list of any physical, mental or medical conditions the Minor may have, 

including any allergies that could impact his/her participation in the Program.  

  

iii) Provide a list of all Program participants and a directory of Program Staff (which will 

include Authorized Adults) to the University Police Department’s Crime Prevention 

Coordinator. This list shall include: participant's name; local room assignment (if 

applicable); gender, age, address, and phone number(s) of parent or legal guardian, as 

well as emergency contact information. This list must also include contact 

information for the Program Director, and must be submitted in the manner and form 

as the sample list attached to this policy. 



The University of Mississippi

iv) Adopt a written policy with delineated procedures concerning first aid, medication, 

inhalers, and epinephrine (“epi”) pens.  Medicine may be administered by a properly 

licensed healthcare professional or distributed by Program Staff for self-

administration by the Minor under the following conditions:  

a) The Minor’s parent or legal guardian must provide written authorization for the 

administration or self-administration of any medicine.   

b) The Minor’s parent or legal guardian must provide the medicine in its original 

pharmacy container labeled with the participant’s name, medicine name, dosage 

and timing of consumption. Over-the-counter medications must be provided in 

their manufacturers’ container.  

c) Medicine should be kept in an appropriate and secure location.  

d) A record showing the date, time, and signature of the person who administered or 

witnessed each self-administration of medicine must be kept for 90 days.   

e) Any medicine the participant cannot self-administer must be stored and 

administered by a licensed healthcare professional associated with the campus, or 

if no one is available, arrangements must be made with another healthcare 

professional in advance of the participant’s arrival.   

f) Personal “epi” pens and inhalers may be carried by the participant during 

activities.  

  

k. If Program Staff is suspected of assault or abuse against a Minor, he or she shall 

immediately discontinue any further Program participation until such allegation has been 

satisfactorily resolved.  

 

l. Program Directors must use the Policy on Supervision of Minors Checklist attached to 

this policy to ensure compliance and should maintain the checklist for audit purposes. 

 

m. Program Directors must retain all records listed above for a minimum period of three (3) 

years.
