The University of Mississippi 

Change in Department Head 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Steps to take concerning inventory, prior to the Department Head leaving 
or changing. 
 
 
Before a department head leaves the university or steps down as department head, he/she should 
contact the University Property Office and request a complete physical inventory prior to change 
in department head status so that discrepancies can be resolved. 
 
When the new department head assumes control of the department, the University Property 
Office should be notified so a complete and current inventory list can be forwarded to the new 
department head.  A physical audit will be completed and the new department head can accept 
responsibility for the departmental inventory.
