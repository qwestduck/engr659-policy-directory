No Lobbying with Federal Student Aid Funds 

 

Summary/Purpose:  To clarify that no federal student aid funds may be used for lobbying 

Affected Persons:  Campus employees 

 

No federal student aid funds may be used to pay an individual to lobby Congress or any member 

of Congress.  No federal student aid funds may be used to influence an individual in the 

awarding of any federal contract or federal cooperative agreement.  No federal student aid funds 

may be used to secure an earmark. 

If any division or department uses non-federal funds for lobbying activities in connection with 

Campus-Based Programs (Campus-Based Programs include the Federal Perkins Loan program, 

Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant program, Federal Work Study program), 

that department or division should immediately contact the Department of Financial Aid to 

determine whether a disclosure must be made to the U.S. Department of Education.
