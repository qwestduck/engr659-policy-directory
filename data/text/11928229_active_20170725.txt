Amplified Sound on Campus 
 

Summary/Purpose:  This policy is for monitoring and regulating amplified sound outdoors on 

campus. 

 

To maintain a community of learning free of disruptions and disturbances, all Registered Student 

Organizations, campus departments, faculty, and staff wishing to host events, gatherings, or 

activities with amplified sound, must seek approval in advance from the office of the Ole Miss 

Student Union.  Amplified sound is considered any sound created or enhanced by the use of 

sound-amplifying equipment. With approval, amplified sound is permitted on Fridays from 5:00 

p.m. until 11:59 p.m., on Saturdays from 12:00 p.m. until 11:59 p.m., and on Sundays from 2:00 

p.m. until 9:00 p.m.  

 

Decibel levels for amplified sound shall not exceed 80 dB from thirty (30) feet from the sound 

source. Requests to exceed this decibel level must be submitted to the Ole Miss Student Union 

office five (5) days prior to the event or activity for approval. Violation of this policy can result 

in immediate termination of the activity. Students and organizations who do not honor these 

guidelines may be referred to the Office of Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct.
