Missed Intake Meeting Administrative Fee 
Policy 

Summary/Purpose 

The purpose of this policy is to establish a fine for students who fail to appear to a mandatory 
intake meeting through the Office of Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct.  

The intake meeting is usually the initial contact that the Office of Conflict Resolution and Student 
Conduct has with a student to discuss an allegation or concern. It is an important step of due process 
and it is important for the University and the student. If someone needs to cancel or reschedule a 
meeting, the student may do so by contacting the Conduct Officer or the Office of Conflict Resolution 
and Student Conduct at least two hours prior to the meeting with no penalty. Individual appointments 
not cancelled at least 2 hours in advance, will be considered a no-show and the student will be assessed 
an administrative fee of $20. If the student is more than 15 minutes late arriving to the appointment, 
the student will be assessed the fee of $20 and will need to reschedule. These amounts will be charged 
to the studentâ€™s Bursar account.
