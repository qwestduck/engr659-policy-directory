Tuition General Policy 
 

Summary/Purpose:  The University of Mississippi Bursar’s policy on assessing tuition.  
 
 
It is the intent of the University to keep at a minimum the necessary expenses of its students.  
Increases are put into effect only when public funds are inadequate and no other recourse is 
available.  Therefore, the University reserves the right to increase or modify fees, tuition, or 
scholarships without prior notice, upon approval by the Board of Trustees.   
 
Tuition is assessed by the credit hour.  There are additional charges for students that are not 
residents of Mississippi.  The University has different rate schedules depending on the program 
of study.  Please refer to the Office of the Bursar’s website at the following address  
https://bursar.olemiss.edu to determine the applicable tuition assessment.  Special course fees are 
also assessed on some classes.
