Collection and Remittance of Sales Tax 
 

Summary/Purpose:  Each department or school is responsible for the collection 
of sales tax when a sale or purchase in his/her area is subject to sales tax.  The 
Accounting Office will assist in the determination of whether sales are subject to 
tax. 

The Accounting Office will register departments with the Mississippi Department 
of Revenue, file all sales tax returns and remit all taxes due for the University.  
Departments must submit a completed return to the Accounting Office no later 
than the 15th of the month in which the return is due.  Included with the return 
should be a memo indicating the profit center that should be charged for the sales 
tax. 

Failure to comply with the above deadline may result in late filing penalties or 
interest assessed by the state.  In the event such charges are assessed, they will be 
the responsibility of the department(s) that failed to submit timely information.
