Checking ID Card Plan Balances 

Summary/Purpose:  States locations where patrons may check card account 

balances 

 

ID card account balances may be viewed at the ID Card Center, sales locations, 

deposit locations, or online https://get.cbord.com/olemiss, or through your 

MyOleMiss account, via GET, which will use your same WebID/Password 

combination that is used for other university services, such as myOleMiss, 

Blackboard, Go mail, and etc. GET allows you to view your ID account transactions 

and balances, and place and remove “lost ID” holds on your ID account. With the 

GET service, you may also deposit funds in your Flex Dollars and Ole Miss Express 

accounts, with a $2.50 service fee. For any questions related to GET, contact the 

ID Center at idcentersupport@olemiss.edu. Account balances are not available by
