\section{Brief Description of the Topic}

In previous sessions, we developed the theory underlying term weighting in documents for the purposes of scoring, leading up to vector space models and the basic cosine scoring algorithm. In this session, we begin with heuristics for speeding up this computation; many of these heuristics achieve their speed at the risk of not finding quite the top-K documents matching the query. Some of these heuristics generalize beyond cosine scoring. After discussing essentially all the components needed for a complete search engine, we take a step back from cosine scoring, to the more general problem of computing scores in a search engine. We outline a complete search engine, including indexes and structures to support not only cosine scoring but also more general ranking factors such as query term proximity. We describe how all of the various pieces fit together. We conclude by discussing how the vector space model for free text queries interacts with common query operators.

\section{Summary of Discussion}

This session covered a number of heuristics and precomputations that can be used to increase efficiency when matching a set of results with a query and improving the quality of that set of results. The session also touched on additional information that may be desirable to store in the database for the class project and encouraged everyone to begin thinking what their own semester project might entail.
